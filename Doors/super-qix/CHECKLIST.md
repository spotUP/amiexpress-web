# Super Qix — FAQ conformance checklist

Source spec: `/Users/spot/Desktop/FAQ_Qix.txt` (Super Qix ARC/PS2 FAQ v1.0.1 by
Johann Mueller, 2003), plus four items reported directly by the user.

IDs are derived from the FAQ's own section numbering. `USER-*` are the
separately reported items.

Status values (REACHABILITY_PROTOCOL §5):
`DONE` · `PARTIAL` · `MISSING` · `CONTRADICTS` · `EXEMPT` (needs a written,
user-agreed reason)

A tick requires Gate 3 evidence: a test that drives the door's top-level entry
point, proves the new code ran, and asserts the spec's stated numbers.

**Total: 74 · DONE: 28 · EXEMPT: 0 · OPEN: 46**  _(last updated 2026-08-31)_

## User-reported (highest priority — these are live bugs)

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| USER-1 | Marker may move ONLY along the outer frame and the edges of claimed area until it draws. Free movement anywhere is a bug. | DONE (tests/movement.test.ts) |
| USER-2 | Drawn stix must be visibly coloured while being drawn | DONE (tests/drawing.test.ts) |
| USER-3 | A completed fill animates right-to-left rather than appearing instantly | DONE (tests/drawing.test.ts) |
| USER-4 | Layout is broken: field is cut off and the footer overdraws it (screenshot) | DONE (tests/layout.test.ts) |

## Decisions taken (user, 2026-08-30)

1. **The FAQ wins on every contradiction.** Remove the Z/X slow-fast draw
   (FAQ-2.5.3d), remove the Super Sparx promotion (FAQ-2.5.3c), and adopt the
   FAQ's level words and default high-score table (FAQ-3c, FAQ-2.5.1). The
   background pictures are not tied to the level names, which is accepted.
2. **Presentation is approximated in ANSI.** Implement the completion sweep
   that erases the stix while revealing the picture (FAQ-2.5.2, partial) and
   the level-16 three-line message (FAQ-3.1). The menagerie of completion
   creatures is EXEMPT: it needs sprite animation a terminal cannot carry.
3. **All three skill levels are implemented** (FAQ-4.1, 4.2, 4.3), selected
   from the menu, with the high-score table recording the mode.
4. **Credit mechanics are EXEMPT** — a BBS door has no coin slot. The 98%
   milestone is kept as a reward (an extra life) rather than a free credit.

### Exemptions agreed

| ID | Reason |
|----|--------|
| FAQ-2.5.2-creatures | Completion creature menagerie needs sprite animation; the stix-erase sweep and picture reveal are implemented instead |
| FAQ-2.3h | No continue/credit concept in a BBS door |
| FAQ-2.4.2d-credit | Extra CREDIT is arcade-only; kept as an extra life at 98% |
| FAQ-4.1-continues | "Allow continues" is arcade-only |
| FAQ-4.2-continues | as above |
| FAQ-4.3-continues | as above |
| FAQ-5.1 | Emergent strategy, no separate code |
| FAQ-5.2 | Emergent strategy, no separate code |
| FAQ-5.3 | Restates FAQ-2.4.1d |
