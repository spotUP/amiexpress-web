# Super Qix — FAQ conformance checklist

Source spec: `/Users/spot/Desktop/FAQ_Qix.txt` (Super Qix ARC/PS2 FAQ v1.0.1 by
Johann Mueller, 2003), plus four items reported directly by the user.

IDs are derived from the FAQ's own section numbering. `USER-*` are the
separately reported items.

Status values (REACHABILITY_PROTOCOL §5):
`DONE` · `PARTIAL` · `MISSING` · `CONTRADICTS` · `EXEMPT` (needs a written,
user-agreed reason)

A tick requires Gate 3 evidence: a test that drives the door's top-level entry
point, proves the new code ran, and asserts the spec's stated numbers.

**FAQ total: 74 · DONE: 74 · EXEMPT: 9 · OPEN: 0**
**QUIX total: 30 · DONE: 30 · OPEN: 0**  _(last updated 2026-08-31)_

## User-reported (highest priority — these are live bugs)

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|

## Decisions taken (user, 2026-08-30)

1. **The FAQ wins on every contradiction.** Remove the Z/X slow-fast draw
   (FAQ-2.5.3d), remove the Super Sparx promotion (FAQ-2.5.3c), and adopt the
   FAQ's level words and default high-score table (FAQ-3c, FAQ-2.5.1). The
   background pictures are not tied to the level names, which is accepted.
2. **Presentation is approximated in ANSI.** Implement the completion sweep
   that erases the stix while revealing the picture (FAQ-2.5.2, partial) and
   the level-16 three-line message (FAQ-3.1). The menagerie of completion
   creatures is EXEMPT: it needs sprite animation a terminal cannot carry.
3. **All three skill levels are implemented** (FAQ-4.1, 4.2, 4.3), selected
   from the menu, with the high-score table recording the mode.
4. **Credit mechanics are EXEMPT** — a BBS door has no coin slot. The 98%
   milestone is kept as a reward (an extra life) rather than a free credit.

## QUIX reference comparison (Q-*)

A second pass, against the QUIX reference implementation
(`https://codeberg.org/SirWumpus/quix` @ `1e1d40dbeb`) rather than the FAQ.
Research: `thoughts/shared/research/2026-08-31_quix-reference-comparison.md`.
Plan: `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-08-31-super-qix-quix-gaps.md`.

Every item below was verified by reverting the change and watching the named
test fail. Where a revert could not fail a test - a negative assertion, or new
code with nothing to revert to - the opposite mutation was applied instead and
is noted.

### Your own line stops you, it does not kill you

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| Q-1a | Walking into your own line refuses the move and costs no life | DONE (tests/gremlin-and-fuse.test.ts `theMarkerCannotCrossItsOwnLine`) |
| Q-1b | A refused crossing lights the Fuse | DONE (tests/gremlin-and-fuse.test.ts `aRefusedCrossingLightsTheFuse`) |
| Q-1c | Backtracking one cell still works and still does not reset the stall timer | DONE (tests/gremlin-and-fuse.test.ts `theMarkerCanBacktrackAlongItsOwnLine`, `backtrackingDoesNotResetTheFuseTimer`) |

### Capturing a Gremlin pays

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| Q-3a | Sealing a Gremlin into a claim counts as a capture | DONE (tests/gremlin-and-fuse.test.ts `sealingAGremlinIntoAClaimCountsAsACapture`) |

| Q-3e | ...and omits it when there were none | DONE (tests/level-outro.test.ts `theBonusPanelOmitsTheCaptureRowWhenThereWereNone`; a negative assertion, so verified by making the row unconditional and watching it fail) |

| Q-4b | All three award sites go through one function | DONE (tests/levels-and-skill.test.ts `everyLifeAwardGoesThroughOneFunction`, asserted against the source so a FOURTH site added later is caught) |

### The door's conveniences

| Q-5h | The high score name is taken from the session, not typed | DONE (tests/controls.test.ts `theHighScoreNameComesFromTheSession`) |

### The ledger

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| Q-6a | CHECKLIST.md carries the QUIX section and the deliberate departures | DONE (this section) |

### Two defects found while reading our own source

Neither came from the reference; both were found while comparing against it,
and both were live faults on the board.

| What | Where it was | Why it mattered |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| High scores were written into `dist/` | `server.ts:12`, `path.join(__dirname, 'highscores.json')` | `__dirname` is `dist/` under the compiled door, and every deploy rebuilds it - so the board was wiped on each deploy. Arkanoid was fixed for exactly this; Super Qix never was. |
| The save RPC rejected any name longer than three characters | `server.ts:63` | A BBS handle is not three initials, so a player called SPOTUP could not get onto the board at all - the same fault Frogger had. `MAX_NAME_LENGTH` already existed at 3 and was ignored: `index.ts` and `server.ts` both hardcoded the figure. |

### Deliberate departures from the QUIX reference (user-agreed)

| Departure | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Tick speed is not scaled by the Gremlin count | The reference's `udelay((10 - quixnum) * 30)` is an 1980s terminal's pacing; ours was measured against BBS keypress timing (~660ms between taps) and retuning it would undo that work |
| Captures pay 250, though FAQ 2.2 says they pay nothing | Agreed with the user: it rewards the trapping play the FAQ itself calls the most spectacular in the game, and the reference pays for it (`quix.c:299`) |
| The filled side is chosen by area, not by Gremlin counts | FAQ 2.1 and 2.2 settle this the other way, and ours follows the FAQ |
| The Gremlin count is capped at four, not the reference's ten | Ten Gremlins on a 38x18 field leaves nowhere to draw. One arrives every fourth level, so a 16-level lap ends at the cap exactly as it ends. |
| The Gremlin count does NOT reset when a lap does | Noted here because it contradicts a FAQ 3 quote already carried in `getLevelConfig`: "there are no changes between the initial L.1 and the L.1 you come back to". That quote is about enemy SPEEDS, which still hold; handing back three Gremlins at level 17 would undo the lap the player just finished, and the reference never resets its count either. `theSecondLapIsIdenticalToTheFirst` still checks the speeds and the level word. |


### Exemptions agreed

| ID | Reason |
|----|--------|
| FAQ-2.5.2-creatures | Completion creature menagerie needs sprite animation; the stix-erase sweep and picture reveal are implemented instead |
| FAQ-2.3h | No continue/credit concept in a BBS door |
| FAQ-2.4.2d-credit | Extra CREDIT is arcade-only; kept as an extra life at 98% |
| FAQ-4.1-continues | "Allow continues" is arcade-only |
| FAQ-4.2-continues | as above |
| FAQ-4.3-continues | as above |
| FAQ-5.1 | Emergent strategy, no separate code |
| FAQ-5.2 | Emergent strategy, no separate code |
| FAQ-5.3 | Restates FAQ-2.4.1d |
| FAQ-2.5.2 | The Joker card and its menagerie need sprite animation. The stix ARE erased and the picture IS revealed, by the wipe the user asked for: "on the arcade the full image draws from right to left when a level is cleared, removing my lines as well" |
| FAQ-4.x-continues | "Allow continues" is a coin-op setting; a BBS door has no coin slot |

### Deliberate departures from the arcade (user-agreed)

| Departure | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Arrow keys alone draw; no hold-to-draw key | In a terminal the arrows are the whole controller, and stepping off safe ground into open field has no other meaning. User: "we can skip holding a key for drawing arrow keys is enough in a bbs context" |
| Enemy pacing retuned (fuse 3000ms, Sparx 0.55, Qix 1.1) | Measured ~660ms between keypresses at BBS pace: people tap arrow keys, they do not hold them. At arcade timings an ordinary draw died 30 times out of 30, always to the fuse, which lit in less time than the gap between two taps. Retuned to 6/30. |
| A Hurry multiplies the pace by 1.4 rather than the arcade's "unmanageably fast" | A terminal redraws a whole frame per tick over a socket. Two stacked Hurries already double the pace here; the arcade's runaway acceleration is unplayable rather than funny at this frame rate. |
| Death does not return the marker to the spawn point | It retreats to where its line began; a death on safe ground leaves it standing. The arcade's respawn point is a fixed board position the player can see coming; here it read as the game throwing away your progress. |
