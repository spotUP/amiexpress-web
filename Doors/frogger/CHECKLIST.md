# Frogger — FAQ conformance checklist

Source: `/Users/spot/Desktop/FAQ_Frogger.txt` (Frogger FAQ, arcade, 1981
Konami/Sega). Every claim the FAQ makes about how the game behaves is an item
here with an ID, so the plan can be executed and ticked in the open rather
than sampled.

Status vocabulary:

`DONE` · `PARTIAL` · `MISSING` · `CONTRADICTS` (the door does something the
FAQ says it should not) · `EXEMPT` (needs a written, agreed reason).

**Total: 51 · DONE: 46 · EXEMPT: 5 · OPEN: 0**  _(last updated 2026-08-31)_

## 8. Quirks in the game

| ID | Item | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FAQ-8a | The frog can be steered during the demo, up to water lane 4 | EXEMPT |
| FAQ-8b | Entering a home as the crocodile leaves credits the home AND kills | EXEMPT |
| FAQ-8c | A frog can dangle off the left of a turtle but not the right | EXEMPT |
| FAQ-8d | Side-to-side movement in water lane 5 is sluggish | EXEMPT |
| FAQ-8e | The purple frog is sometimes invisible | EXEMPT |

### Exemptions agreed

| ID | Reason |
|----|--------|
| FAQ-8a | There IS an attract demo now, but its keys open the menu rather than steering the frog - in a door the keyboard is how you start a game, and the arcade's steerable demo is a quirk of the coin slot |
| FAQ-8b | Being credited for a home AND losing a frog is a bug in the arcade ROM, not behaviour worth reproducing |
| FAQ-8c | Dangling off one side of a turtle but not the other needs sub-cell positions; a terminal cell is the smallest thing there is here |
| FAQ-8d | Sluggish side-to-side movement in water lane 5 is a defect of the original hardware |
| FAQ-8e | An invisible lady frog is a rendering fault, not a feature |

### Readings and departures

| Item | Reading |
|------|---------|
| FAQ-7a "ten spaces" | The FAQ says ten, but its own field diagram draws five road lanes, a median, five water lanes and the home row - twelve rows. The door follows the diagram. |
| FAQ-7c "cars travel left to right" | Taken literally: every road lane runs left to right. The real cabinet alternates them, and the FAQ's own field diagram does not say either way; the FAQ's sentence is the only statement on it, so it wins. Worth revisiting if the road plays flat. |
| FAQ-6.3h 256 lives | Offered in the menu, but the row of frogs in the status line switches to a count above eight rather than drawing 256 of them. |
| Lane 5 crocodile count | The table's C says lane 5 IS crocodiles but gives no number; three is used, matching the medium-log counts either side of it in the table. |
