In this release 4.9 there are a few changes.
 
First:> Make sure you make a PartDownLoad Directory in your bbs: 
        With this version we are working on the bbs remembering flagged
        files when you logoff, so that next time you call they will still 
        be flagged.
 
Second:> If you are using Workbench 3.0 and above you will notice that 
         the Red, White color problem in Express is now working. The
         Console.Library was corrected by Commodore, and allowed us to 
         finally make the fix that everyone has been wanting for a long
         time. Remember you will only notice the fix if you are running 
         WorkBench 3.0 or above.

        1. Added RIP script support to AmiExpress, every place that you
           have a bulletin or screen you can have a RIP script. AmiExpress
           recognizes RIP scripts as files with the extension '.RIP'. These
           screens follow the same rule as other screens.
 
           For the system to recognize a user as having RIP capability they
           must select 'R' from the ANSI prompt.

        1. Added new access tooltype ACS.TRANSLATION, this tooltype
           specifies the language the user prefers.
           
           AmiExpress will look for a directory icon called Languages.info
           This icon will stores a list of languages that the users may
           select from. The tooltypes for this icon are as follows:
 
           a. HOSTLANGUAGE=<language> there should be only one of these
              tooltypes in the icon. This specifies your system's default
              language.
 
           b. LANGUAGE.x=<language> this tool type can occur several times
              as long as you replace '.x' with an occurance number ie:
              LANGUAGE.1=English, LANGUAGE.2=Spanish etc.
           c. TITLE.x=<language title> title works the same as language
              except it is more of a banner line for the language, and will
              be used in the menu options when the user asks which language
              they prefer.
 
        The user can select the language of his choice via the 'W' menu
        prompt command, it is option '15' , a user's language preference
        is not saved in the user.data, it is reset to the HOST default
        at logon time.
 
        NOTE: REGISTERED DEVELOPERS, PLEASE REFER TO THE DEVELOPERS 
        CONFERENCE ON THIS OPTION.
 
        APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPEMENT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
        OF THIS FEATURE.

/X 4.5b
 
        1. Fixed 'EH' bug in internal message bases. You can now change the
           FROM field in the message. In order to invoke this feature you
           must have ACS.MESSAGE_EDIT access.
 
        2. Modified the StatBar to make room for a 3 digit conference
           number.
 
        3. Added SCANMAIL_PROMPT to the NODE icons. If this tooltype is
           present then the user will be asked if they wish to scan for
           mail. NOTE if a user chooses 'NO' then they will not get any
           EALL messages.
 
        4. Fixed bug in Hydra Interface, now /X will scan the other node's
           playpens directories for duplicate files when uploads occur.

/X 4.5b
 
        1. Added new tooltype ACS.ACCOUNT_VIEW to the access icons.
           This access will allow the user to use the account editor in
           READ ONLY mode. This takes effect on the REMOTE side only. If
           the user has ACS.ACCOUNT_EDIT, then this will overide
           ACS.ACCOUNT_VIEW.
 
        2. Added new flat file 'LockAccounts', this file goes into the
           BBS: directory, and can contain a list of users. 
 
           If this file is present then only users listed in the
           LockAccounts file will be able to edit accounts. 
 
           This overides ACS.ACCOUNT_EDIT and takes effect on the REMOTE
           side only.
