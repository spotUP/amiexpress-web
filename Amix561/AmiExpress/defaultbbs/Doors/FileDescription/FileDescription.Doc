                -----------------------------------
                       Release date 07-31-94

Hello, and welcome to the best fileid extractor door you've ever seen on
Amiexpress.  There  has never  been  anything  like  this  door  before.

File Description  is a fileid extractor  such as FileID by ByteAndi, but
is much more powerful.   Probably  the  most  powerful  fileid extractor
available for amiexpress today!

This  door works  and  have been tested  on AmiExpress 3.20+.  I haven't
tested it  on  any other  amiexpress  clones such  as  S-Express, but it
should work there too.

New things in version 1.1 (Read Updatefile for more details):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* All reported and found bugs  are been removed.  I NEED your bugreports
  so we can get  filedescription free  from all sorts  of bugs  and make
  it 'the perfect fileid extractor'.
* File Description  have now support for removing these lame bbs-ads out
  of the file_id.diz.

Notable Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* File Description have  a  powerful Fullscreen Description Editor where
  the users write/edit/create a description (This is ofcourse configable
  for each user).
* File Description have support  for autodetecting grouplogos. The sysop
  can add how many logos he/she wants (Unlimited).
* File Description have a nice looking userconfig editor where the users
  can configure his/her personal settings.
* File Description (UserConfig Editor)  have built  in  userhelp so even
  braindead people can use File Description.
* File Description have  support  for removing thoose  lame bbs-ads that
  nowadays are available in the fileid description.
* File Description have been tested and works 100% on multinode systems.
* File Description is much faster then other fileid extractors. Probably
  becouse if its high optimized code.
* File Description is written entirely in C for fast code.
* File Description  comes  in  68000 and 68020  code  to get the maximum
  speed on your system.
* File Description have everything needed built in. No need for external
  programs such in FileId by Byteandi (SENT.X)
* File Description is the nicest looking fileid extractor available, and
  is the easiest one to use and install.



                               INSTALLATION
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~
File Description  requires  the  following   things  to  run  correctly:

* A fully installed and running amiexpress v3.20+. File Description have
  not  been  tested  on  any other  amiexpress  clones, but should work.
* A fully installed and running workbench v37+.

  --- This four files should be available in this release archive.

If you have the above things, you  can  continue with this installation.
Otherwise quit and  get/buy  the  missing  thing  becouse it won't work!

To install File Description, start with copying the included icons where
they should be located. (This installation is ONLY for Amiexpress 3.20+)

------------( Snap this lines )---------------------------
Copy RAM:Commands/BBSCmd/SENT.info BBS:Commands/BBSCmd/
Copy RAM:Commands/SYSCmd/EXAMINE.info BBS:Commands/SYSCmd/
----------------------------------------------------------

Continue with making a  directory in doors: called 'FileDescription' and
copy the executable files,docs etc.

------------( Snap this lines )---------------------------
Makedir Doors:FileDescription
Copy RAM:Doors/FileDescripion/FileDescription.#? Doors:FileDescription/
----------------------------------------------------------

Now copy the  executable file 'FileDescription.<cpu>' (depending on what
cpu you have) to 'FileDescription.x'

(THIS IS  JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING INCASE YOU LOOSE THE LHA
PACKAGE)

EG: Copy FileDescription020.x FileDescription.x
(If you have 68020+ cpu)

That's it!  Please feel  free  to contact me  if  you are having trouble
installing the tools.  My numbers are  at  the bottom  of this document.



                              CONFIGURATION
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File Description  is  not running  on  icons, since  the most  of us are
hating them (Included me).  Instead i am using scriptfiles, looking like
the one used by Super-Dupecheck (By Pot-Noodle). This will also make the
door alot faster and smaller.

The following external files are available:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FileDescription.Config  (Configfile)
FileDescription.Logos   (Available grouplogos)
FileDescription.Strip   (Lines to strip)
FileDescription.Help    (User Onlinehelp)

NOTE  You don't need to change any of  this files  if you don't want to:
      * Add/Remove filetypes.  The following filetypes are  supported in
        the default config: (DMS,ZIP,TXT,LHA,LZH).
      * Add/Remove/Disable description  logos.
      * Add/Remove striplines.

FileDescription.Config:
-----------------------
The following keywords are available:

Template = Pack_<ext>: Packstring
 Example = Pack_LHA: Lha a %P %Wfile_id.diz
 Default = NONE

Keywords in string: %P - filename with full path.
                    %W - work directory.

Eg, the above example would be replaced with >:
Pack_LHA: Lha a BBS:Node1/playpen/FILE.LHA BBS:Node1/work/file_id.diz

This  is  the Packstring for  each filetype.  The sysop can add how many
file-types as he wants (Unlimited).

Template = Depack_<ext>: Depackstring
 Example = Depack_LHA: Lha e %P file_id.diz %W
 Default = NONE

Keywords in string: %P - filename with full path.
                    %W - work directory.

Eg, the above example would be replaced with >:
Depack_LHA: Lha e BBS:Node1/playpen/FILE.LHA file_id.diz BBS:Node1/work/

This is  the Depackstring for each filetype.  The sysop can add how many
file-types as he wants (Unlimited).

Template = Config_Access: Accesslevel
 Example = Config_Access: 20
 Default = 0

This  is the  security  level  needed to let a  user  configure  his/her
settings.

Template = Disable_Fsde
 Example = Disable_Fsde
 Default = FSDE NOT disabled.

If  this  is  specified,  the  fullscreen  description  editor  will  be
disabled.  Only  use  this  if you are  having  problems with the  FSDE.


FileDescription.Logos:
----------------------
The following keywords are available:

Template = Group: Groupname
 Example = Group: Mystic

This the the full name of the group.

Template = Detect: <name>
 Example = Detect: MST-

This is how File Description should autodetect a grouplogo IE if someone
uploads a file starting with MST-, file description will ask the user if
he wants to use a MYSTIC logo.

Example of a group (MYSTIC)

Group: Mystic
Detect: MST-
.___/\____/\_ __/\_____/\__/\_/\___ __ ____.
|______ __  / _   ____  ___  _  __//_//    |
|\/ / / /  /  /\_  \ /  //  /  /__         |
¦/ / / /\__  /  /  //  //  /  /  / ____    |
/_/_/ /___  /___  //  //  /\__  /__\  /____.
____ /____ /____ /__ /__ /____ /___\\//_   ¦
|  \/bIS \/    \/  \/  \/    \/     \/     |
#

Remember: Each LOGO must end with a (#). The description should be 10*44
          chars, otherwise it will be cut.   If the group don't have any
          DETECT, enter NONE. (IE Detect: NONE)


FileDescription.Strip:
----------------------
In this file  you should write the lines you want to  be stripped ie the
lines  you don't want to  have in your directory (bbs-ads).  You may use
'?' as  a wildcard  incase the add include  the date/time  of uploading.

ie if an add look like this:
[11:19:12] DOWNLOADED FROM XXXXXX [07-28-94]

you may enter (in filedescription.strip):
[??:??:??] DOWNLOADED FROM XXXXXX [??-??-??]
