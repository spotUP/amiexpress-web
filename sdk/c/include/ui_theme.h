/*
 * ui_theme - the board's themes, at the eight colours a C door has.
 *
 * The sysop's answer to "must a C door look like its TypeScript twin?" was
 * yes - "the identity of our doors is important" (2026-09-02) - so all seven
 * themes are here, not just classic.
 *
 * THE TABLE IS GENERATED, never hand-edited: sdk/engines/ui/theme/tokens.ts
 * stays the one place a theme is defined, and tools/generate-theme-tables.ts
 * reduces each token to one of eight colours. `make check-themes` fails when
 * the header is stale, so the two cannot drift in silence.
 *
 * What does not survive the reduction, and why that is honest: `double`
 * borders (ansi_box draws + - |, so double degrades to line) and the exact
 * shades (a hex ramp has no 8-colour equivalent). What DOES survive is the
 * identity - phosphor stays green, neon stays magenta - which is the part a
 * caller recognises.
