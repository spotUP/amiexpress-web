/*
 * ui_list - a bordered list with a selection and a scroll bar.
 *
 * The widget the catalogue actually needs: nearly every door in the door
 * list is "show these rows, let somebody pick one". DOORMAN draws it with
 * blessed; this draws the same thing in a C door, at eight colours and in
 * plain ASCII, because on a real Amiga the terminal is topaz-8 and a
 * multi-byte box character renders as mojibake.
 *
 * The list OWNS the scrolling arithmetic, which is the part every hand-rolled
 * copy gets wrong: a selection that walks off the bottom has to pull the
 * window with it, a window must never show past the end, and a list shorter
 * than its box must not scroll at all.
