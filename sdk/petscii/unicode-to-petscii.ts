/**
 * Unicode (box drawing, block elements, the few symbols a BBS prints) ->
 * PETSCII byte.
 *
 * Only glyphs whose SCREEN CODE renders the same in BOTH charset banks are
 * mapped as plain bytes: screen codes $60-$7F (PETSCII $A0-$BF) EXCEPT the
 * two that diverge ($69 and $7A), plus $40 (horizontal bar), $5B (cross),
 * $5C (left half medium shade, the same bitmap in both banks) and $5D
 * (vertical bar), and the bank-1-only check mark (screen code $7A ->
 * PETSCII $BA) since transduced text is always printed in bank 1. Screen
 * codes $41-$5A are LETTERS in bank 1, so the bank-0-only graphics that live
 * there - card suits, the bullet, the rounded corners, the diagonals - are
 * substituted with punctuation instead of mapped, or they would come out as
 * random capitals.
 *
 * Glyphs that exist in bank 1 ONLY - a different bitmap lives at the same
 * screen code in bank 0 - are kept OUT of this map and listed in
 * UNICODE_TO_PETSCII_BANK1_ONLY below, which `asciiToPetsciiByte` consults
 * only when it is encoding for bank 1.
 *
 * Glyphs PETSCII only has as the INVERSE of another glyph carry `{ rvs }`;
 * the transducer wraps those in $12/$92 and restores the latched SGR reverse
 * afterwards.
 *
 * Every byte here is `screenCodeToPetscii(sc)` of the screen code the repo's
 * normative screen-code -> Unicode table assigns to that glyph:
 * web/backend/src/utils/petscii-unicode-map.ts (`SCREENCODE_TO_UNICODE`,
 * transcribed from the Unicode Consortium's C64IPRI.TXT / C64IALT.TXT
 * interchange mappings, L2/19-025). The inverse was generated from that file
 * and is pinned cell by cell in tests/petscii/unicode-to-petscii.test.ts.
 * See also thoughts/shared/research/2026-09-01_true-petscii-reference.md
 * sections 2 and 4.3.

/**
 * LATIN-1 HIGH BYTES ($A0-$FF) -> a character the table above (or

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A 68K door's output is decoded as latin1 on its way out of
 * the emulator (`web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/DosLibrary.ts:1222` and
 * the FileHandle path), so the code point that reaches this encoder IS the
 * byte the door wrote, and the picture the caller was MEANT to see is the
 * Amiga Topaz glyph for that byte. Before this table `asciiToPetsciiByte`
 * resolved 92 of the 96 to '?' - only $A0, $A3, $AF and $B7 were mapped - and
 * five doors the board already marks C64_ADAPT=40 (`j`, `ulist`, `six_status`,
 * `hackcheck`, `doorrepo`) put unmapped bytes on a C64's glass every run.
 *
 * METHOD. Every row was decided from the two BITMAPS, not from the code
 * point's Unicode name. Topaz was rasterised 8x8 from
 * `web/frontend/public/fonts/Topaz_a500_v1.0.ttf` (upem 1600, advance 800, so
 * the native 8x8 cell is every second row of a 16px render) and each candidate
 * PETSCII glyph 8x8 from the PetMe64 outlines the terminal itself renders from
 * (PUA $E000 + bank*$100 + screen code), then compared by Hamming distance
 * over the 64 pixels. The rasteriser was sanity-checked against known cells -
 * PetMe64 bank 0 screen code $01 is 'A' and $5E is pi, bank 1 $01 is 'a' - the
 * same check `7eaa120d5` used. Distances quoted below are out of 64.
 *
 * The label lies more often than not, which is the whole reason to raster:
 * $AF is nominally MACRON and is really the top-of-cell rule Amiga art draws
 * with (already mapped, $A3); $AD is nominally SOFT HYPHEN and Topaz draws a
 * real 2px mid-height bar for it, a hyphen; $BC-$BE are nominally fractions
 * and are three diagonal-hatched cells the board's own BBSTITLE uses as a
 * shading run (`.¾¾¾¾¾.` in Screens/BBSTITLE.txt).
 *
 * Every value here is a REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, not a PETSCII byte:
 * `asciiToPetsciiByte` re-enters itself once with it, so the bank rules, the
 * letter ranges and the table above stay the single source of truth and no
 * bank-divergent byte can be introduced through this door. Targets are ASCII
 * or a glyph already in UNICODE_TO_PETSCII; none is itself a latin1 high byte,
 * which the tests assert so the recursion cannot become a cycle.
