# Scripts Directory

All project scripts are organized here by category.

## For Future Development

When creating new scripts, place them in the appropriate subdirectory:
- deployment/ - Deployment, CI/CD, release automation
- arexx/ - BBS automation, door scripts
- build/ - Build, compilation, packaging scripts

Create new subdirectories as needed for new script categories.

See README.md for full guidelines.
