To install AmiExpress you must have at least all the Requirement which were mentioned above. Now lets get going on with the normal installation of AmiExpress. 

It is recommended to start with either a partition or an assign BBS: which is where your BBS will reside. The two main parts of Ami-Express are ACP and Express. ACP is the management GUI and the central part of the system that will launch instances of Express to handle each node.

ACP can be launched either from WBStartup, Manually or from S:User-Startup. Express would normally be copied to the root of your BBS: but can actually be configured to run from any location.

Ami-Express relies heavily on configuration files that drive the way the software operates. This will be described in the next section.
