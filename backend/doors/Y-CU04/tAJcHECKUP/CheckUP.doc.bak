                               ============

Requirements:
=============
-       Amiga OS2.04 or better.
-       A running Rexxmast.
-       Any BBS system which uses logoffscripts.
-       512kb of memory (not much).
-       rexxsupport.library in your LIBS:


Is this for free ???
====================
Sure it is! Ofcourse if you want to you can write me a note on my BBS
to say you like it (or not), so it makes my ego feel good.


What is this for ???
====================
This is actually a very simple gadget! It's used for checking if there
are files in a certain directory (mostly the upload-directory of a BBS)
and based upon the result it will run a certain scriptfile.
I use this in my logoffscript of /X, but ofcourse you can also use this
on other BBS programmes too, I guess.


Syntaxis:
=========
CheckUP <uldir> <ulscript> <noscript> [W] [M] [Mdir]

<uldir>    :    Pathname (Must end with ":" or "/") to search for Files.
                (for example: -> bbs:amiga/uploads/ <-)

<ulscript> :    Scriptfile which will be run when there are found files
                in the selected <Uldir>.
                (for example: -> bbs:node1/logoff.uploads <-)

<noscript> :    Scriptfile which will be run when there are not found
                any files in the selected <Uldir>.
                (for example: -> bbs:node1/logoff.none <-)

[W]        :    If you use this optional flag, the scriptfiles will be run
                in an open window. This way you can see the output of all
                tools you run in your script. BUT, the Node will go online
                immediately when the script is being started. If you leave
                this option out, the scripts will just be executed like any
                normal logoffscript and the node will be held busy while
                doing so.

[M]        :    If you use this optional flag, all files in the <uldir> will
                be moved to [Mdir]. BUT (!!!), this will only work when
                you DON'T use the [W]-flag.

[Mdir]     :    Pathname to where all files in the <uldir> will be moved
                after either the <ulscript> or <noscript> has been run.

N.B.
----    You don't NEED to use the optional flags, they're just here for those
        who feel like they need it.



Examples:
=========

CheckUP U: BBS:logoff.uploads BBS:logoff.none M U2:

CheckUP U: BBS:logoff.uploads BBS:logoff.none W

CheckUP U: BBS:logoff.uploads BBS:logoff.none



IMPORTANT!!!
============
Since this tool checks a certain <uldir>, it is mandatory that you move the
uploaded files after each RUN of CheckUP to a secundary directory so the
<uldir> will be empty each time a user logs on to your BBS.
You can do this yourself by adding a simple line to your <ulscript> like:
move dir1:#? dir2:
(Where 'dir1' and 'dir2' are the directory names, any fool can see that*8).)
You can also let CheckUP do the work if you want, but only when you don't use
the [W]-flag.

If you enter 'CheckUP ?' it will show you a full description of the syntaxis
to use.
