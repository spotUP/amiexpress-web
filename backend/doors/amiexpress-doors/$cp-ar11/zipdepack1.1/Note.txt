Hi Guys out there ..... Have u been looking for a working Version of
this really fine Tool ? Which could really depack the File_id.diz out
of ZIP-Files ? 

Well, now it is there ... I've been working on this about 2 min's to
fix it because the Version 1.1 of Cyborg/Arcade didn't manage File-Id's
which is written in Capitol-Letter or even if one Character has changed
to Caps. So i decided to handle with it and found the Tool 'ZipDepack 1.1'
which can depack the hole Zip-File into a specified Dir. This is included
in this Package (special thanks goes therefore to R/\[>I[]SITY which made
it --> Really Good !!!!). I would say that this is an additional Coding so
nothing has to be changed as the main-File in your Rexx:-Dir!!!! You only
have to copy the ZipDepack-script into your REXX:-Dir - that's all !!!

                               Ok have Fun with it now!
