First Beta of Release 4



b02:
====
NOTE: The docs haven't changed since beta-01 so they're not included with
      beta-02.
    * IF YOU DIDN'T GET BETA-01, GET IT, BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO READ THE
      NEW DOCS FOR INFO ON THE CHANGES SINCE Release-3!

      The Super-DirAdd and Super-DirStrip support programs haven't changed
      since Release-01 either, so those haven't been included.

Fixed StDr: - with cross-archive-checking it wasn't saving the .XXX of files.

StDr: Will not add filename to stripped-down dir-listing if it is detected as
	a private upload.
	Could you people please test this for me because it's a right pain in
	the arse to test this feature seeing as it's for /X3+ and I'm using
	/X2!   Pleale let me know if it works correctly!

To Do: (I really don't know when I'll do this, I really shouldn't do any
       coding until after my exams if I want to do at all well in them!)

1) Totally take over the FCheck handling from /X so that StDr: can not add
   files that fail the check.
   Make it a new config so that people can have different checkers in diff
   conferneces...

   The way it'll be is: You'll have a line in your config file like

   .LHA: Doors:DupeCheck/DMS_FCheck.CFG

   and if it's a .LHA file it'll load up the filename given, which'll have
   something like:
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ; LHA FileChecker config for Super-DupeCheck
   Before=DH0:Tools/System/Packers/Utils/LHA T
   After=-m -F -N -I -Qa -Qw -Qo
   Fail=FAILED
   Fail=CORRUPTED
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   and it'll use that to do the FCheck...

   You'll be able to have different checkers for different confs etc, and you can
   even not check files uploaded to certain confs...


2) Add an option which makes the internal /X FCheck stuff run, for those
   who don't want to setup the super-dupecheck FChecking...

3) Add a BAN: command which would (like Free:) send all e.g. ATX-#? files to
   the hold dir for sysop review.


-) Please note that the changes for Beta-02 were very small and I have not
   checked anything, so, for your own sake, please be around for the first
   hour or so that this new version is running, coz there is a chance that
   I've done something really stupid!...

Quickly added (WHILE ONLINE!) LZX support to the cross-arc-checking.
(For MDR who kept bugging me).
(Not tested, but should work).
