                                 PRESENTS

                  -=> BestConf V1.0 - ASM XIM DOOR <=-

    PROFESSIONAL TOOLS FOR PROFESSIONAL SYSOPS - GET THE REAL QUALITY !


WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS TOOL ?
-----------------------------

        This door displays a list of your top-uploaders,
        per conference !

        There is a fucking great new design done by
        Noisy Belch (thx man) !

        If you use /X3.x+ you need CONFERENCE ACCOUNTING TURNED ON !
        (Simply because /X3.x+ does not store the creds in Conf.DB
         when turned OFF, LAME !)

        If you are a lucky user of S-Express V0.39m+ then there is
        no matter if Conference Accounting is ON or OFF, works in
        both cases (S-Express rules) !

        Enjoy !

HOW TO INSTALL :
----------------

        Copy the files in the archive to your directories,
        they are :

        BBS:Doors/BestConf/BestConf.Config
        BBS:Doors/BestConf/BestConf.XIM
        BBS:Doors/BestConf/BestConf.Doc
        BBS:Doors/BestConf/BestConf.Header
        BBS:Doors/BestConf/BestConf.Tailer
        LIBS:AEDoor.library ( © Sintax/WOT )

        The BestConf.Config looks like this :
 
        --------(cut here)--------
        10                                 <- Amount of Users to display !
        BBS:User.Data                      <- The Location of your User.Data !
        DOORS:BestConf/BestConf.Header     <- Headertext to be displayed !
        DOORS:BestConf/BestConf.Tailer     <- Tailertext to be displayed !
        --------------------------

        The Tailer-Text can be left out.
        

        Now if you use /X2.x or S-Express then append the
        BBS:Commands/BBS.CMD to your BBS.CMD !

        If you use /X3.x copy the BBS:Commands/BBSCMD/BestConf.Info
        to your BBS:Commands/BBSCMD/ !
        
        Ok, now the door is installed and a user can call it with
        typing BESTCONF, but normally you want it displayed during
        logon sequence ! Use this in a file during logon :

        ~CC_BESTCONF

        This will call the door !

        The advantage is that you don't have to add another util
        to your logoffbatch !!!

        For help how to use it via MCI commands, e.g. during logon,
        look at the BBS:Screens dir in the archive !

        Now you're ready to enjoy !


 |||    Only for S-Express users :
 |||    If it shows weird things, just grab the latest S-Express
 |||    version from Synergy ! Should work perfectly on some
 |||    newer versions to come !

P.S. :

Since I currently do not know what's up with GOD, I release this stuff
under my name ! I always wanted to continue the group but it looks like
that most members can not call for free/are inactive  ! If there is any
active member left I would be lucky if you can contact me (see above) !

If there is any good group which wants an allround-coder, simply contact
me...

Let the scene go back to the good old days... have fun out there !
