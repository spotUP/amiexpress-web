# GitHub Push Blocked - Large File Issue

## Issue
Cannot push commits to GitHub due to large file in git history.

## Error Message
```
remote: error: File SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup is 116.83 MB
remote: error: This exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected
```

## Root Cause
The file `SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup` (117MB) was committed in an earlier commit:
- Commit: `94e2f64` - "Complete Sanctuary BBS Connection Screen Layout"
- This is in the git history and blocks ALL pushes

## Current Status
**Local commits ready to push:**
1. `61cff2f` - feat: Implement AmiExpress file listing and flagging system (Items 1-5)
2. `a2224eb` - feat: Add FS command (file statistics) and A command (alter flags) - Items 6-7
3. `af68d03` - docs: Update progress - 7/19 items completed

**Unpushed commits:** 3
**Work completed:** FS command, A command, complete file listing system
**Backend status:** ✅ Running successfully
**Code status:** ✅ All compiles and works

## Solutions

### Option 1: Remove Large File from Git History (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove file from all commits
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup' HEAD

# Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner (faster)
bfg --delete-files CLogBackup
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push
git push origin main --force
```

### Option 2: Use Git LFS
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large file type
git lfs track "*.CLogBackup"
git lfs track "SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup"

# Migrate existing file
git lfs migrate import --include="SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup"

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Add to .gitignore and Remove
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup" >> .gitignore

# Remove from git but keep local file
git rm --cached SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup

# Commit
git commit -m "Remove large file from git tracking"

# Still need to clean history (use Option 1)
```

## Recommended Action
1. Use Option 1 to remove the file from git history
2. Add to .gitignore to prevent future commits
3. Force push to update remote

## Files to Add to .gitignore
```
# BBS Log Files
*.CLogBackup
SanctuaryBBS/Node1/CLogBackup
**/Node*/CLogBackup
**/CLogBackup

# Other large BBS files
**/Logs/*.log
**/Backups/*
```

## Temporary Workaround
All code is committed locally and working. The issue only affects pushing to GitHub. Local development can continue normally.

## Impact
- ❌ Cannot push to GitHub
- ✅ Local commits are safe
- ✅ Backend is running
- ✅ All new code is committed locally
- ✅ Work can continue

## Next Steps
1. User should run Option 1 commands to clean git history
2. Add large files to .gitignore
3. Force push to GitHub
4. Continue development

**All work is saved locally. This is a git housekeeping issue, not a code issue.**
