        Transfer Acitivities [RELEASE 2] - Public Release Version!
                   All Coding by Bobo (Mystic/X-Power)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all sysops.  There have been  quite some time since  the last release
from me, but here it is.  This is one of the  last doors i am ever going
to release on the amiga, due to lack of time.

Well, I guess the most of you sysops know  what this door is and what it
does, but to the ones that  have been lost for some years, here's a fast
introduction:

This door is  intended for MULTINODE systems only and  cannot be used on
single node systems. The main purpouse of this door is to show if a user
on any other node is transfering something, and if so, it tells you  the
current  file that  he is transfering  and what files in his batch  have
already been finished.

AS A BONUS, the sourcecode to this door is included in the archive.
AS AN EXTRA BONUS, screenshots of the new Conftop 3.0!


An example output may look like this:

`----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

If you run a  multinode bbs,  this door is almost a must and should be a
standard on all boards.  This door also fully supports quiet nodes, so a
user can exclude himself from WHAT easy - just to use the 'Q' command in
amiexpress.

Keep in mind that this door ONLY works on the new versions of amiexpress
that supports 32 nodes. A version for the old amiexpress 2/3 series and
SExpress may be done if requested.

--------------------------------------------------------( Installation )---

WHAT requires a fully installed and running amiexpress 3.x (32 node).
It WON'T work on eairlier versions of amiexpress or S-Express.

WHAT doesn't require any configuration.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All sysops should know how to install a standard XIM-door, but you'll
never know, so here's a fast breif.

To install WHAT, start with copying the included icon where it should be
located.

------------( Snap this lines )---------------------------
Copy RAM:Doors/WHAT/WHAT.info BBS:Commands/BBSCmd/
----------------------------------------------------------

Continue  with making  a directory  in doors: called 'WHAT' and copy the
main program, docs etc.

------------( Snap this lines )---------------------------
Makedir Doors:WHAT
Copy RAM:Doors/What/#? Doors:What/ ALL
----------------------------------------------------------

That's it!  Please  feel free  to contact me  if you  are having trouble
installing the tools.
