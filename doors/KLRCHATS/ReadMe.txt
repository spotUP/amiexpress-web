Hi!

Welcome  to  the  complete and last archive ever of Chat-O-Meter.
What  you've got here is not only the program itself but also the
source  code.   Never  before  has  this  source  code  been made
available to the public.

I've  deciced  to  make it public domain because I'm not going to
work  on  it  anymore  and  maybe  somebody  else  does  have the
motivation  to  do it.  If you are a programmer and you think you
can improve it, go ahead.

I'm  certain  there  are a few bugs in there but it seems to work
pretty  good.  It only goes a bit wobbly sometimes when you start
to  chat  on  i.e.   Monday  night  and end somewhere on Tuesday.
Maybe you can find the solution.

For  more  information  about the function of the program, please
read the accompaning guide.

Enjoy!
