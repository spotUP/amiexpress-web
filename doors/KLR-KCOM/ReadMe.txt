Hi!

Welcome  to the last archive of Killer-Comment.  This archive not
only  contains  the  executables  but  also the source code.  The
source code has never been made available before.

Killer-Comment  is a program made the Ami-Express BBS system.  It
serves as a replacement for the built-in 'C' command.  Instead of
just  writing a comment to the sysop the user can now choose from
a  list of people.  Users can make their choice with their cursor
keys or their keyboard.  It has limited intelligence in the sense
that  it's able to recognize to whom a message must be written if
a part of the name is given as an argument.

For instance, if "C killr" is entered on the command line of Ami-
Express,  Killer-Comment will be able to tell it's supposed to be
sent  to Killraven/MYSTiC (given that that name is in the list of
people who can get a comment).

More  features  can  be  found  in the guide that comes with this
archive.

The reason as to why I am releasing the source is simple.  I made
this  door  quite  a  while  ago  and  I  will not fiddle with it
anymore.   Maybe  somebody  out there wants to improve it or even
remove a bug (if there is any).  I encourage you to do so.

Enjoy!

-Robert- (aka Killraven/MYSTiC)
