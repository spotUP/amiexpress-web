Please note - some of the things in the 'others' directory were about the
3rd or 4th programs I ever wrote, so please don't think that all of my
current code is this crappy!!

I'm just including all this shit for the curious, and just in case someone
wants to update the utils (if you ask me you're better off writing many
of them from scatch!)
