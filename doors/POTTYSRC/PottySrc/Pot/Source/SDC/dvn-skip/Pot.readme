I had planned on writting a program similar to this as one of the
Super-DupeCheck 'support programs' (like SDirStrip and SDirAdd).

One day I saw this on a board and found it does exactly what I had
in mind, so I had decided to include this util with SDC instead of
writting my own version, which would have been a waste of time.

I hope the author doesn't mind. I have included the entire contents
of the archive.
