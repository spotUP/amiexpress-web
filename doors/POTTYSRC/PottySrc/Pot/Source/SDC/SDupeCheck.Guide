@NODE Thrash "Super-DupeCheck: P0T-NOoDLE, a.k.a. Thrash?"
	This has been iritating Thrash (and keeping me highly amused!) for
ages... We've both said this before (Thrash more times than me! heh heh!),
but:
                       "Thrash" NOT = "P0T-NOoDLE"

	I (P0T-NOoDLE) did NOT write ThrashTop, ThrashBar, ThrashConf, or
any of the other utils with the very subtle Thrash* prefix. I only did
some basic ANSI ideas for them which Thrash developed into utils before
I could even code (in most cases), and the newer utils from Thrash have
had even less to do with me!!
	A lot of people seem to think that any util with blue & yellow bars
and the word "Anthrox" in is automatically written by me. Well, Thrash
wrote lots of them too, and his name is on them! (See the @{" list " LINK Others}).

	It's just a pitty people don't think that I wrote all the utils
with blue & yellow bars (but without "Anthrox"), coz then people would
think I wrote all those hundreds of programs that rip of my style (then
again, maybe I'm quite glad people don't think I wrote some of them).
@ENDNODE
@NODE Charity "Super-DupeCheck: Children of the Storm!"
	I know that most you out there won't pay anything at all, but I am
doing this in the hope that at least a few people donate even a small amount
of money, because every little penny can be put to some good!
	Please, at least read about the charity, Children of the Storm.
I not going to say that anyone who doesn't send off some money should feel
really guilty, just that anyone who does send off some money should feel
really great, knowing that they've helped someone out.
	Even if you don't want to send any money (for whatever reasons),
you could always send a letter of support, or spread the word to other
people.

	I have never asked for any money for all the work I put into these
utils, and I do not gain anything from your donations except knowing that
I have helped some people out. I know that my work is used by a lot of
people and that because of that, I have helped them out in one way or
another, so why not help someone else now! Scene members do have hearts,
don't they? Make it worth my while typing all of this info!




Who are the CHILDREN OF THE STORM?
----------------------------------
In Britain this year, over a hundred young children will be accepted into
the country by the Home Office, seeking political asylum. They may be just
eleven or twelve years old. Often they have travelled across continents
alone. They may have just lost their parents, seen brothers and sisters
brutally murdered, or suffered beatings or torture themselves. Whilst our
Government offers them basic shelter and the long-term possibility of
war-refugee status in the UK, they can live here for weeks and months under
the threat of instand deportation, sometimes forced to live rough without
provision for food, clothing and other simple necessities. Far from their
home and their culture, hungry, fearful and insecure, these children
attempt, often with an astounding dignity and human spirit, to survive and
grow despite the weight of unbearable memories they carry deep within...



Background
----------
Since 1989 several members of the staff at Hampstead School have been
building up a support network for refugee children attending the school
who have little or no family back-up, few resources, and are often in a
critical emotional state.

Achievements to date include:
- providing food, shelter and income for regugee children, working with
  the Tavistock Clinic which is providing counselling services and
  advising teachers,
- forging links with the local authority (London Borough of Camden) to
  put children and carers in touch with any relevant support agencies,
- establishing a social club in which refugee children are offered
  additional tuition and emotional support by their fellow pupils at
  the school,
- acting as the children's advocates in relation to housing, social
  services, social security etc.



Status
------
Registered Charity number 1035774
Consultant: Sheila Kasabova, Refugee Co-ordinator, Camden Council
Consultant Psychologist: Maureen Fox, Consultant Psychotherapist at the
                         Tavistock Clinic
Legal Consultants: Bindmans (services at no charge)
Accountants: Alan Heywood, Chartered Accountants (services at no charge)



Aims and Objectives
-------------------
1	To continue to build on the existing project achievements outlined,
2	To extend knowledge acquired by staff and pupils of the school to
	other schools and bodies dealing with refugee children through
	teacher-training programmes, conferences, booklets etc.



Summary of Projects in Progress or Anticipated
----------------------------------------------
1	Publishing a booklet: the Hampstead Story, by those involved in the
	project, outlining the problems Hampstead School itself has
	encountered with refugee children and strategies for dealing with
	them. To be delivered free of charge to every school in the country.
	Cost: £9,000. Project in progress.
2	Expanding the social club outlined above to include students from
	other local schools including primary schools.
	Cost: £50 per month. Project in progress.
3	Employing a full-time counsellor at Hampstead School to counsel
	children and train staff in counselling techniques.
	Cost: £38,000 pa.
4	Employing an administrative assistant to manage the charity.
	Cost: £20,000 pa.
5	Holding a national conference on problems faced by refugee children
	in Britain, and strategies for overcoming them, open to any persons
	or organisations working with regugee children (teachers, welfare
	and social servicesm volunteer groups etc.)
6	Employing a fundraiser.
	Cost: £15,000 pa.



Conclusion
----------
The project originated at Hampstead School is the only one of its kind. Due
largely to recent wide coverage and acclaim in local, national and
international media, it is increasingly being recognised by local
authorities as a role model for other schools.
Central to the project's success is teacher Athy Demetriades, who has
assisted on training days in schools around the country. Regular requests
for her to speak now come from solicitors, educational psychologists,
welfare services and radio programmes as well as schools. On average, she
fulfils one such engagement per week. She is, in effect, becoming one of few
experts on the all-round care of children suffering a unique combination of
problems - the destruction of the childhood together with the loss of
citizenship and any automatic recourse to law and welfare that citizenship
entails.

Sponsorship for Children of the Storm would ensure that the work originated
at Hampstead School can continue. It would also lay the foundations for a
training programme enabling teachers and carers right across the country to
provide the basics of security and education to refugee children.

	I want to say a huge thanks to anyone who does donate some money.
My one request is that anyone donating money writes in their letter that
they found out about the charity from this util. If you wish, include your
scene-handle and I will make a list of everyone who has donated.

@ENDNODE
@NODE WhatIs "Super-DupeCheck: What IS a DupeChecker?"
	It's likely that you already know what a DupeChecker is, but just
in case you've been living on another planet I will explain.

	Most boards in the scene are fast moving, throbbing, pulsating,
huge highways of fast warez, supported by sysops and users who only have
time for the newest, hottest, creamiest, horniest files.
	Often, due to honest mistakes or due to stupid assholes and people
new to the scene, files get uploaded that are really old that everyone has
already got. Sometimes people even upload files that have already been
faked and deleted off a board. These occurances really are a pain in the
arse and it usually means that some poor sysop or one of his/her friends
has to spend time checking out all the files and deleting the lame ones.
Whoever has that job must waste time doing such a mundane job while he/she
could be getting some kind of sexual excitement, or even sleeping.

	A dupechecker won't solve this problem entirely (for example, it
won't set you up with a girlfriend, boyfriend, or sheep, so for those of
lacking in social skills or friendly farmers, we have to stay with our
hands and `toys' (and I don't mean consoles there)) but it will at least
help. A system that is running a dupechecker can keep its filelists of old
and faked stuff which is no longer online, and check all new uploads
against the old lists. If someone uploads a file that has already been on
the BBS they'll be told, lose their creds, get a spanking, and be sent to
bed without a whore/stud/flossi. (Obviously, if they upload a file that IS
still on the BBS, the software will abort that upload before the file
exists, unless they do it in another conference). A good dupechecker can
aid in stopping people uploading files that are already online in a
different conference of the same board.

	For a dupechecker to be really usefull it should have access to a
large filelisting. This means that the program that does the checking has
to be able to search through long lists of files. Because every file that
is uploaded has to be checked, it is not good if the checking takes a long
time because whoever uploads the file has to wait for it, and if people get
pissed of about uploading, they might stop and get a life. We can't allow
people to get lives because the scene would die and then we would all have
to get lives ourselves.

	So there you go. "Running a dupechecker will help keep the scene
together, could improve your sex-life. It's even been blessed by the
Pope, so what are you waiting for??"
	Also: Because Super-DupeCheck has such a beautiful proportional bar
which graphically displays how much of a directory has been checked, people
will upload more to your BBS because they will upload just to see the dir
get checked!! No longer is waiting for a DupeCheck boring and tedius!

	Standard dupecheckers for Express are run as filechecker doors. The
problem is that Express only has space for one filechecker door (well, OK,
Sigma-Express has space for two, but its the same story) meaning that the
sysop would either have run a dupechecker, or a filechecker (or find a door
that does both). For this reason, dupecheckers have always had the option
to run more doors. (At least this is true to my knowledge!)


	There are probably more, but as far as I know there are two other
dupecheckers available for Express.
	The original DupeCheck was written by Sigma-Seven and has been
around for some time now. Sigma gets full credits for the idea, and also
helped me with the developement of this dupechecker. Sigma's program
allows for another door to be run, but it was written in "E" which means
it is really slow, especially when checking a few a megs of filelistings,
like on Enterprise. Having to wait for the dupecheck on Enterprise after
every upload, and the fact that Sigma had no plans to upgrade his version
were the two things that motivated me to write my own version of dupecheck.
	Soon after I started coding my version, FastDupe was released by
Byteandi and Dr.Dre (who did other great doors like NewFiles). Their door
is much faster than Sigma's and they also added the option of running upto
ten other doors as well as skipping dupe check for certain users and access
levels.

	My door does everything that these two do, and more, in a very
flexible and totally configurable way. Of course, it's faster as well!
(That's why I wrote it).

The FastDupe docs say:
      "Special Greetings to Sigma Seven....please don`t be worry but 
       C! is Faster as E!"
and I say "Please don't worry either, as A! is Faster than C! and E!".
@ENDNODE
@NODE Features "Super-DupeCheck: Features."
Written entirely in ASSEMBLER for FAST code.
Can be made resident.
Can run as many other filechecker-type doors as you want.
Can display text files, different ones for each conference, as well as
	global ones for all conferences. As many as you want.
Can automatically flag uploaded files as free downloads if they match a
	given pattern, and are, optionally, under a certain size.
Cool percentage-done progress bar! Great for knowing how long it'll take!!
32-Node compatable. (Actually, upto 100nodes) I've yet to find a BBS with
	more than 9 nodes to test it on.
"Script"-style config file allows an infinite number of different doors and
	text files to be used in any order, before or after dupechecking.
	The most flexible system possible!
Can use a global script used in all conferences and/or seperate scripts for
	individual conferences.
Skips checking files if they are found out to be a duplicate. (There's no
	point in testing the archive integrity of a file that is of no use!)
	Also means that people don't get credits in week/conf-tops for
	uploading duped files. (Assuming the stats-updater is a door).
Allows for DupeChecking to be skipped for Named users.
Allows for DupeChecking to be skipped for certain access levels.
Allows you to specify the path to additional directory listings to be checked
	which means that you can easily have cross-conference dupechecking.
Allows for a special Dupe-Checker filelisting ("DirD") that is not online
	for the users to read, but is still used for dupechecks.
Allows for DupeChecking to be performed only on the older dir(s) in each
	conference, so that the upload (and new) dirs of online files do
	not have to be checked (if files are online, they can't be duped).
	It is also possible to specify the range of dirs to be checked, for
	example, you could make it only check Dir3, Dir4, and Dir5.
Allows for a special Global-Dupe-Dir listing that is seached for uploads in
	ALL conferences to provide for checking of uploads that are already
	online in another conference. (This dir can be selectively disabled
	for any or all conferences)
Actual DupeChecking does NOT have to be performed, so the program can be
	used to display messages and run lots of filechecker doors, or even
	to run another dupechecker, if a better one should be written.
Optionally, will check for filenames that are archives (*.LHA/ZIP etc) and
	check for dupes of any other archive type. So that ERPERP.LHA would
	be counted as a dupe of ERPERP.ZIP. Still allows there to be .DOC
	files etc, and it can always be turned off altogether.
Skips DupeCheck on private uploads. (If it has access to the filedesc).
When a file is duped a message is put into the callerslog telling you the
	name of the duped file.
When a file is duped the file description of the dupe is shown to the
	uploader.
Can automatically maintain a stripped down directory listing which speeds
	up dupechecking. A util is included which will also convert
	existing directory listings into stripped down versions. Another
	util is included which makes it easy to maintain these in a program
	such as DirectoryOpus.
Allows for "NastyDupCheck" style dupechecking using the FilesNotAllowed.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Running "Super-DupeCheck: Running the Door with Express."
Making Express run it:
	This door should be installed as your standard FileCheck door.
Don't worry about the door that was there before, SDupeChk will run that
for ya. On /X-3 you have to edit (or create) the FileCheck.info in your
SysCommands directory. On S-X and /X-2 you have to edit the
BBS:Commands/SYS.cmd in the usual way.
	I expect that you are either not stupid, or have someone else
setting up the util (like all your other doors!) who has some form of a
brain, so I won't patronize you and tell you how to install a door. Just
remember to give it a low access level (Like "001"!) and make it multinode.

	The door is an XIM type, of course!
	The door doesn't need much stack, give it the default.
	Also, for added speed, you may make the door resident with your
normal "resident" command (CLI: "Resident DOORS:SDChk.x PURE"), but if you
do, make sure that Express runs just the DoorFileName, without its path!
(I think with /X3 there is a "resident" tool type, but I'm not sure what
it does?? I just saw it in the FastDupe icon.)

	Now the hard part, you have to edit the @{" CONFIG FILE " LINK Config}...

@ENDNODE
@NODE PutIt "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - Where to put it."
	The door will look for the config file in two different places.
First it looks in the directory of the conference where the user is
uploading. If it is not found there, the program looks in the S: directory.
This allows you to have customised config files for any or all of your
different conferences, as well as a general one. (Or you could just use the
general one in the S: directory.) Please note: If it finds the config file
in the conference directory, it will take NO NOTICE of the file in the S:
directory, so you cannot have "global" and "local" prefs that combine into
one set of options (IE it doesn't parse the global file and then parse the
conference file, it JUST parses the conference one, unless it is not
available).
	The config file is always called "SDupeChk.cfg".
For example, if the user is in the Amiga conference and that is located in
"BBS:Amiga/", after uploading, the program will try to use the config file
called "BBS:Amiga/SDupeChk.cfg". If, and only if, it cannot find this file,
it will try and use "S:SDupeChk.cfg". If it cannot find either file, it
will fail to run and will exit cleanly with an error, returning Express to
its usual process.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Works "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - How it works."
	The config file has been designed with flexibility in mind. It is
not much like the standard config files for other utils where you just
specify a few set values. Instead, the Supe-DupeCheck config file is more
like a script of commands. The program will look at the script line-by-line
and execute the commands IN THE ORDER THEY ARE GIVEN. This is true for ALL
of the commands and it is therefore important that you make sure that any
command that sets up data for another is run first. For example, the
@{" `Name:' " LINK Name} command tells the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command to skip checking if the user
has a specified name. The "Name:" command should always be run before the
"Check" command because if it is run after it, the "Check" will already
have been performed, before the "Name:" command was processed.

	It is important that you correctly give all of the commands the
data that they require. The program has been written so that it
(hopefully!) will exit cleanly on an error, without crashing your BBS, but,
obviously, if an error occurs the DupeCheck cannot be performed.
	All of the commands require the following format:

<Command-Name>,<Space>,<Argument>,<Return>

For example:

Name: P0T-NOoDLE

or

Check U

If you forget the space after the commandline, don't give it an argument,
have a space before the command name, or don't remember to put a return at
the end of everything (REMEMBER THIS ON THE LAST LINE!) it is likely that
the command will not be recognised and the dupechecking will be aborted.

	Please note that the command names and arguments are *NOT* case
sensitive. You can enter "Name:", "name:", "nAmE:" "NAME:", "NamE:" or
whatever you want, should you wish the config file to look `elite', it's
all the same to the door.

	It is important to remember that those commands placed after the
"Check" command will only be executed IF the dupecheck is successful (that
is, if a duplicate is NOT found). See the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command for more info.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Comments "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - Comments."
	You can `comment out' any lines that you want Super-DupeCheck to
ignore by placing a ";" at their start (the same way that you do it in
AmigaDOS scripts). This allows you to write notes to yourself, or to
disable certain lines that you do not want run, but still want to keep in
the file (maybe you're trying out some new setups and don't want to have to
re-type the line if you decide to turn the option back on).
@ENDNODE
@NODE AcCh "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `AcCh:' Command."
	When the @{" `Door:' " LINK Door} command is run you may tell dupecheck to set the
user's access level to 255 while the door is run.

	The `AcCh:' command is used to tell the `Door:' command whether or
not it should alter the user's access level. Because of this you must put
the `AcCh:' command BEFORE the `Door:' command(s) you want it to affect.
	The `AcCh:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es the user's level WILL be set to
255 for all doors run after the command. If you set it to "N"o the user's
level will be left as it is. Note that the user's access level is restored
after the doors have been run.

	Note that you can have more than one `AcCh:' command, allowing you
to run some doors with a 255 access level and others with an unchanged
access level.

For example:

AcCh: Y
Door: Server
Door: Check_Archive
AcCh: N
Door: Show_Stats

This would run the doors Server and Check_Archive with an access level of
255 and then run the Show_Stats door with the user's real access level.

	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "Y"es (all doors will be run with 255 access
level).

	Please read the documentation on the @{" `Door:' " LINK Door} command for reasons
why you might want to use this command.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Arcs "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Arcs:' Command."
	The `Arcs:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command whether
or not it should use @{" `cross-archive-checking' " LINK CAC}. For this reason it should
always be placed before the `Check' command in the script.

	The `Arcs:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es `cross-archive-checking' will
be enabled. If you set it to "N"o it will be disabled.

	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "Y"es.

	The `Arcs:' command is the only command that you are not allowed to
use more than once in the script because of the actions that it performs on
the programs internal copy of the uploaded filename. This is no problem
though because there is absolutely no need to run the `Arcs:' command more
than once anyway.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Axes "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Axes:' Command."
	The `Axes:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command to skip
the actual dupecheck itself if the uploader has a high enough access level.
For this reason you must place the `Axes:' command before the `Check'
command in the config file.

	The `Axes:' command requires an decimal-number argument of one to
three digits. The number that you give to it is the MINIMUM access level
for the dupecheck to be skipped.

For Example:

Axes: 200
Check U

Then if the user has an access level of 200 or above the `Check' routine
will not waste their time performing a dupecheck and will automatically
pass the file. (All other commands after the `Check' WILL be run as
normal).

	If you leave this command out of the script file all together no
users will have Checking skipped (unless you use the @{" `Name:' " LINK Name} command).
Please note that you CAN use the `Axes:' and `Name:' commands together,
meaning that you could, for example, skip checking for everyone with access
of over a certain level, as well as a select group of named people.

For Example:

Axes: 50
Name: P0T-NOoDLE
Name: Hydro

Would skip dupechecking for any user with access level of 50 or higher, as
well as skipping dupechecking for P0T-NOoDLE and Hydro. (If P0T-NOoDLE or
Hydro also have access level of 50 or more, the dupechecking is still
skipped (But not skipped twice &8^} )).

BTW the "&" looks like a rolled up dog-turd, and that face is my "shithead"
@ENDNODE
@NODE Check "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Check' Command."
	The `Check' command is the most important part of the config file.
This is the command that actually performs the dupechecking itself.

Some of the other commands have an influence on how `Check' performs...

@{" `Arcs:' " LINK Arcs} Tells it whether or not to do `cross-archive-checking'.
@{" `Axes:' " LINK Axes} Tells it to skip checking for users of certain access levels.
@{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} Tells it the paths of other directories to check.
@{" `Glob:' " LINK Glob} Tells it whether or not to check the GlobalDir.
@{" `LoDi:' " LINK LoDi} Tells it the lowest directory to check.
@{" `HiDi:' " LINK HiDi} Tells it the highest directory to check.
@{" `Name:' " LINK Name} Tells it to skip checking for certain named users.
@{" `Anim:' " LINK Anim} Tells it whether or not to use Animated ANSI.
@{" `Kill:' " LINK Kill} Tells it whether or not to "kill" duped files.


	The `Check' command itself requires one argument of a single
letter. This letter is used to define whether the dupe-check is performed
on an Upper-Case dir-listing or a Mixed-Case dir-listing. Most sysops set
the option (CAPITOLS_IN_FILE) in Express that makes all of the filenames
in the dir-listings uppercased (i.e. all CAPITAL LETTERS). If you do this
you should tell the `Check' command to use the Upper-Case routine as it is
a little bit faster. If, on the other, you have mixed-case dir-listings,
or are unsure about what the hell all of this means, you should tell the
`Check' command to use the slightly slower Mixed-Case routine.

	Enter "Check U" to use the Upper-Case routine, or
	enter "Check M" to use the Mixed-Case routine.

	One of the first things that the `Check' command does is to check
if the @{" `Axes:' " LINK Axes} and @{" `Name:' " LINK Name} commands have told it that it should skip
the dupechecking. If they have told it to do so, it will output a message
saying that the dupecheck has been skipped due to a `special user' and the
program will continue with next command(s) in the config file.

	The next thing that the `Check' routine must do is work out which
dir-listing files it should look through. For Super-DupeCheck there are
three different types of dir-listings:

(1) @{" Global-DupeDir " LINK Dir_G}
(2) @{" Dupe-Directory " LINK Dir_D}
(3) @{" Standard Dirs. " LINK Dir_S}

NOTE: Don't Ignore these buttons, they contain a great deal of information
----- that you will need. They've just been reduced to buttons to make it
----- easier to find everything. READ THEM NOW.



	If you have read the documentation on the @{" `Arcs:' " LINK Arcs} command you
will have come accross @{" `cross-archive-checking' " LINK CAC}. This is yet another
unique feature of Super-DupeCheck and if you use the botton I will attempt
to explain it to you.


	Once the `Check' command has worked out what it's going to do the
actaul checking is done. If no duplicate is found the program continues
with the next commands in the config file. However, IF A DUPLICATE IS FOUND
the file is FAILED AND SENT TO HOLD, and NO COMMANDS AFTER THE CHECK
COMMAND ARE RUN. This means that any commands that you always want to be
run MUST be placed BEFORE the `Check' command. Think about them before you
move them to the top of the file though. The reason that no further
commands are run when a `Check' fails makes a lot of sence:
	Usually the dupe-checker door will run other doors that test the
archive structure and perhaps a door that updates a conf-top or a week-top
or something (like BigBoss' Server door). If a duplicate file is found
there is no point in testing the archive because it is being moved to the
hold dir to be deleted anyway. You certainly don't want to run an
upload-stats updater door if a duplicate is found because it means that
users get credits in the week-top for uploading a dupe. I can think of only
a few doors that you would want to run even if a dupe is found, so it's a
good idea to stick all the filechecker and stats-updater doors AFTER the
`Check' command!! (See the @{" `Door:' " LINK Door} command.)


	One final thing about the `Check' command... Even though this door
was written primarily as a Dupe-Checker, you do NOT have to run the `Check'
command at all. You could use Super-DupeChecker as a tool to run lots of
different doors (such as filecheckers, stats-updaters, or even a new
Dupe-Checker!) and show some text files when someone uploads; what you do
with the config file is totally up to you. Hell, you can even run the
`Check' command twice and perform two dupechecks (pointless, but still
possible).

	Addition: When a file is duped a message is put into the
callerslog telling you the name of the duped file.
	Also, when a dupe is found, the file-description of it is shown
to the user so that they can see if the two files really are the same.
(or perhaps the old version had a CRC error or something and was deleted).
This allows the user to complain if their file was legit, and if not, shows
them how OLD their file is (unless, of course, it's a stripped-down dir-
listing with all the extra information removed)!
@ENDNODE
@NODE Dir_G "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Check' Command, Global-DupeDir."
1) The GlobalDupeDir is one of the unique features of SDChk. This is a
standard dir-listing (Like BBS:Conf/Dir1 etc) with the exception that its
filename is "BBS:GlobalDupeDir". No matter which conference Super-DupeCheck
is run from, it will always use "BBS:GlobalDupeDir" as the path to the
GlobalDupeDir. This allows you to add all or some of your directories from
your different conferences into one large file that is ALWAYS checked. This
is a nice idea for people who have a seperate AmiExpress-Utils conference
or something like that as it can be used to stop people uploading Express
utils into the main Amiga conference if they are already online in the
Utils conference.
	It is easy to understand that the GlobalDupeDir could become very
large. If you wish to make it smaller (and speed up the dupechecking) you
can strip out all of the file descriptions, leaving just the filenames. If
you do do this to the GlobalDupeDir, or any other dirs, please keeps this
important point in mind:

  Super-DupeCheck ALWAYS check for a 13 letter filename, adding spaces at
  the end when the real filename is shorter. All filenames in your dir-file
  must have enough spaces after them to make the line they're on at least
  14 chars long (including the return).

So if you wanted to strip down this listing:

	This may seem like a hard task if you have listings of a meg or two,
but as of Release 4, Super-DupeCheck comes with a support program called
@{" Super-DirStrip " LINK SDirStrip} which will do the job for you!
	You should also take note of the @{" `StDr:' " LINK StDr} and @{" `SdIn:' " LINK StIn} commands
which are used to make Super-DupeCheck automatically update and maintain
stripped-down dir-lisitngs.
	Also, there is another support-util called @{" Super-DirAdd " LINK SDirAdd} which can
be used in conjunction with a program like DirectoryOpus to make it easier
for you to add filenames to a cut-down dir file when you move or delete
them.
	Hints and warnings on using Global-dupe-dirs and stripped-down dir-
listings are contained in a @{" separate section " LINK SDDHAW}.

	The first thing that the `Check' command does is to find out if you
have told it to dupecheck any dirs by giving it their direct path using the
@{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command (for example, you could tell it to check the dir file(s)
in one of your other conferences). If you have, the file(s) will have a dupe
check performed on them.
	Having done the above, the `Check' command looks to see whether or
not the GlobalDupeDir has been disabled by the @{" `Glob:' " LINK Glob} command. (You may
want to do this to disable checking of the large GlobalDupeDir for certain
conferences. For example, there is little point in making people sit and
wait for a huge dir to be processed when they are uploading into a private
group members' conference). If the GlobalDupeDir has been disabled it will
be skipped. Otherwise the program checks to see if the GlobalDupeDir exists
in BBS: or not. If it does it is checked like any other dir-listing. If it
doesn't, it is skipped as if it had been disabled.
	This means that if you are not interested in having a
GlobalDupeDir, you don't have to do anything. If the program can't find it
no errors will be produced, it will just assume you don't want it and
continue checking the other dir-listings.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Dir_D "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Check' Command, Dupe-Directory."
2) Directory-D is another unique feature of Super-DupeCheck. Picture this:
You have an Amiga conference that has three months worth of stuff online.
While the stuff is online people cannot upload duplicates because the files
already exist on the harddrive. However, once the stuff gets deleted (maybe
by the great automated util "AFL-DEL" by SPY/AFL) some lamers start upload
some files that were on the board a few months ago (or even years ago!!
Defender of the Crown rules.). The easy solution is to keep a filelisting
of all the files that you have deleted so that the dupecheck can use it.
Many boards have offline-file dir-listings for this reasons. While many
boards want their listings to be online (they might offer users the change
to request a file that is on tape-backup or something), often the only
point in these old-listings is for the dupechecker. So why the hell should
the users be able to view these files? They can't download any of the
stuff, all the files do is get in the way (and sometimes you get some
dickhead who decides to do a "F A NS" and spends two hours capturing the
whole dir listing).
	The solution to this problem is Directory-D. This is exactly the
same as the standard upload file-listings, except the filename is
"CONF/DirD" instead of "CONF/Dir1", "CONF/Dir2", etc. The DirD file cannot
be viewed by any users using the "N" and "F" commands, but dupecheck will
still search it, if it exists. If you don't want to have a DirD, don't have
one. When Super-DupeCheck finds that there is no DirD file it will assume
that you're not interested in this feature (s0b) and will skip to the
standard upload dir-listings.

	You may wish to remove all of the non-filename data from DirD to
make it smaller and faster. If you do wish to do this you should first read
through the section on stripping-down dir-listings in the section on the
@{" GlobalDupeDir " LINK Dir_G}, as well as the docs on the @{" Super-DirStrip " LINK SDirStrip} program which
comes with Super-DupeCheck and does the job automatically.
	You should also take note of the @{" `StDr:' " LINK StDr} and @{" `StIn:' " LINK StIn} commands
which are used to make Super-DupeCheck automatically update and maintain
stripped-down dir-lisitngs.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Dir_S "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Check' Command, Standard Dirs."
3) The standard upload directories are just what you would expect them to
be. They are the files shown whenever your users use the "N" and "F"
commands. You know the ones, the "CONF/Dir1", "CONF/Dir2", "CONF/Dir3" etc
files (upto your NDirs).

	You can change the range of dirs checked using the @{" `LoDi' " LINK LoDi} and
@{" `HiDi' " LINK HiDi} commands. @{" `LoDi' " LINK LoDi} tells Super-DupeCheck the lowest dir to check
(skipping all those before it), and @{" `HiDi' " LINK HiDi} tells it the highest dir to
check (skipping all those after it). So if you want to check all dirs
between Dir5 and Dir17, you use "LoDi: 5" and "HiDi: 17".

	Please note that if you only have online files listed in your
standard directories and have taken advantage of the @{" GlobalDupeDir " LINK Dir_G} or
@{" Directory-D " LINK Dir_D} you may want to set `HiDi: 0' so that NONE of the standard
dirs are checked, just the GlobalDupeDir and DirD.
@ENDNODE
@NODE CAC "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - `Cross-Archive-Checking'."
	Normally when a dupechecker is searching for a file it simply
checks for the filename as it is. This is normally all that is required.
However, sometimes there may be a file online that contains exactly the
same things but has been archived with a different program. I can only
think of a couple of times where this has happened on the Amiga (someone
released a .ZOO archive and later on the same archive was released in .LHA
format, the filenames were identical apart from their extensions), but I
have been told that it can happen quite a lot on the Console scene coz
certain lame-computer owners don't have LHA and need to use LZH files and
shit like that (I must stress that I have nothing to do with these TOYS, I
hate fucking consoles).
	`Cross-archive-checking' means that if an uploaded file has a
recognised archive extension, any file in the dir-listing with the same
extension or another one of the other recognised archive extensions will be
counted as a dupe.

Currently there are five recognised archive extensions:

"*.ZIP", "*.LHA", "*.LZH", "*.ARC", "*.ZOO"

This means that if "ERPERP.LHA" is in the dir list,
"ERPERP.ARC" will be counted as a dupe, but "ERPERP.DOC" will *NOT*.

Please be careful with this because it is very possible that a game may be
released on the PC as GAME.ZIP and then on the Amiga as GAME.LHA or
something. If you have a GlobalDupeDir and PC and Amiga Conferences it may
be a good idea to keep them seperate from each other.

	This is only an option so if you think that it may cause problems
on your BBS, it might be a good idea to disable `cross-archive-checking'
using the `Arcs:' command. (Set "Arcs: N") With `cross-archive-checking'
disabled the DupeChecking itself will also be VERY SLIGHTLY speeded up,
but you would never notice the difference.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Door "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Door:' Command."
	This command allows you to run other doors such as archive-testers
and stats-updaters whenever someone uploads. The doors should be standard
FileChecker type doors because Super-DupeCheck will send the name of the
uploaded file to them in the standard way. Most other non-FileChecker doors
will work as well, so long as they don't read their commandline (the
BB_MAINLINE command). (For example, a newfiles door wouldn't function very
well, but then you'd have no reason for running it!).
	This is one of the areas where Super-DupeCheck is very usefull
because you can have as many `Door:' commands as you want, thus allowing
you to run a virtually infinite number of different doors after every
upload.

	The door command requires the name of the door to be run as its
argument. Express must be told about this door in the BBSCommands (An icon
in the BBSCommands directory for /X 3.x, and the text file
BBS:Commands/BBS.Cmd for SX and /X2.x).

For example, if you have a door defined in BBSCommands called Server:

Door: Server

would run the Server door after every upload.


	One important point. Because all doors that are to be run by
Super-DupeCheck must be defined in the BBS-Commands (there is no way of
running doors from the SYS-Commands), a user could just run any of these
doors from the command prompt.
	To work around this problem, you should set the access level of
all doors that you want protected to 255. This means that normal users
cannot run them at normal times, and only you and people you trust
(i.e. those with 255 access level.) can. If you do this, you should make
sure that the @{" `AcCh:' " LINK AcCh} command is ON before the protected door(s) are run.


	Please note also that no doors (or anything else for that matter)
are run after a `Check' command if a duplicate file is found. For further
information on how and why this is so, please see the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command.
@ENDNODE
@NODE StDr "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `StDr:' Command."
	The `StDr:' (Stripped Dir) command can be used to update
stripped-down dir-listings files by adding the name of the file being
uploaded to the end of them.
	The @{" `StIn:' " LINK StIn} command controls whether or not this command adds
extra information about the date and the size of the file.

	The `StDr:' command simply requires the name of the stripped-down
dir-listing as its argument. If the given file does not yet exist, it will
be created.
	So that files detected as dupes are not added to the stripped-down
dir-listings, the `StDr:' command should always be placed AFTER the @{" Check " LINK Check}
command in your config script.

For more information on Stripped-down dir-listings see:

 @{" Hints and Warnings " LINK SDDHAW} on Stripped-Down Dir-Listings
 @{" Global-dupe-dirs " LINK Dir_G}.
 The @{" `StIn:' " LINK StIn} command.
 The @{" Super-DirStrip " LINK SDirStrip} support-util docs.
 The @{" Super-DirAdd " LINK SDirAdd} support-util docs.


	For example, if you wanted to update the stripped-down dir-listing
named "BBS:Stripped-Dir", you should have the follow after your @{" Check " LINK Check}
command.

StDr: BBS:Stripped-Dir

	Of course, if you do use stripped-down dir-listings, don't forget
to have Super-DupeCheck actually perform a dupe-check using them!!
See the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command for information on how to do this.
@ENDNODE
@NODE StIn "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `StIn:' Command."
	The `StIn:' (Stripped Info) command controls how much information
is included in the stripped-down dir-listings files created by the
@{" `StDr:' " LINK StDr} command.

	The `StDr:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es extra info will be included in
the stripped-down dir-listings. If you set it to "N"o, the extra info will
not be included.

	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "N"o.
	You MUST include this command before the @{" `StDr:' " LINK StDr} command in your
config script.

	If you do include the extra info, when someone uploads a dupe
they'll be shown the size and date of uploading of the original file. If
you do not include the extra info the stripped-down file will be even
smaller and even quicker to dupecheck.


	For example, if you want to have a stripped-down dir-listing
named "BBS:STDir_1" with the extra info, and another one named
"BBS:STDir_2" without the info:

StIn: Y
StDr: BBS:STDir_1
StIn: N
StDr: BBS:STDir_2

	Remember that the @{" `StDr:' " LINK StDr} command should be placed after the
@{" Check " LINK Check} command.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Glob "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Glob:' Command."
	The `Glob:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command whether
or not it should use check the @{" GlobalDupeDir " LINK Dir_G}. For this reason it should
always be placed before the `Check' command in the script.

	The `Glob:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es the GlobalDupeDir will be
enabled. If you set it to "N"o it will be disabled.

	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "Y"es.

	You can change the range of dirs checked in the current conference
using the @{" `LoDi:' " LINK LoDi} and @{" `HiDi:' " LINK HiDi} commands, and you can tell the program
the exact path of one or more dir-files to be checked using the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF}
command.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Anim "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Anim:' Command."
	The `Anim:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command whether
or not it should use check the Animated ANSI. For this reason it should
always be placed before the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command in the script.

	When dupechecking starts, a short ANSI animation is randomly
selected to draw the name "Super-DupeCheck" onto the screen. Normally,
most people would want this left as it is, as it is quite pretty, however,
the `Anim:' command provides the option for the ANSI animation to be
disabled, for whatever reason (for example, you being a boring sysop, or
the animations messing when people have really bad lines that can't cope).

	The `Anim:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es the Animations will be
enabled. If you set it to "N"o they will be disabled.

	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "Y"es.

	The `HiDi:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command the
highest number of @{" standard-upload-file-listing directories " LINK Dir_S} to search
in. For this reason it should always be placed before the `Check' command
in the script.
	This command can be used in conjunction with the @{" `LoDi' " LINK LoDi} command
in order to specify the range of Directories to be Checked.

	The `HiDi:' command requires an decimal-number argument of one or
two digits (i.e. any number from 0 to 99). The number that you give to it
is the highest dir that dupecheck should search in.
	Note that if you set "HiDi: 0" NONE of the standard dirs will be
looked at and checking will only be performed on the GlobalDupeDir and
Directory-D, if they are enabled themselves.

For example, if in your conference directory there are five dir files,
"Dir1", "Dir2", "Dir3", "Dir4", and "Dir5"

HiDi: 0
; Above won't check any of the dirs.

HiDi: 3
; Above will check "Dir1", "Dir2", and "Dir3"

HiDi: 10
; Above will check "Dir1", "Dir2", "Dir3", "Dir4", and "Dir5"


	If you leave the `HiDi:' command out of the script entirely a
default of "99" will be set. (99 is the maximum number of dir-files
supported by the current version of Super-DupeCheck, and I can't see anyone
ever needing even that many!)

	You can tell the program the exact path of one or more dir-files to
be checked using the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command.

	If the @{" `LoDi:' " LINK LoDi} and `HiDi:' commands are not flexible enough
for you (for example, you may want to check Dir3 and Dir5, but not Dir4)
you are able to set both of them to 0 (zero) (which on its own would mean
that NONE of the dirs in the current conference would be checked), and then
use the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command to make only Dir3 and Dir5 be checked.


@ENDNODE
@NODE Kill "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Kill:' Command."
	The `Kill:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command whether or
not to "kill" files that are dupes.

	Normally, when a dupe file is uploaded it is sent to the hold dir so
that the Sysop can deal with it. This is what happens by default if you don't
use the `Kill:' command at all in your config script. This means that you
will be able to look at any files that are flagged as dupes and decide
whether to delete the file, keep the file (maybe it's an old game you wish
you'd kept), or put the file online (maybe it has the same name as a
previously uploaded file, but is in fact different).

	If you would rather the util delt with the file, you can enable the
`Kill:' option which will replace all duped files with a very small comment
(like most "Nuke" and faker utilities do when you fake a file) which means
that the file won't be wasting space on your harddrive.
	The program cannot actually delete the file because AmiExpress
expects to find it in order to move it into your hold dir.

	The `Kill:' command requires a single letter argument of either "Y"
for Yes, or "N" for No. If you set it "Y"es, "kill" mode will be enabled.
If you set it to "N"o, "kill" mode will be disabled.
	If you leave this command out of your script completely it will
default to being set to "N"o.
@ENDNODE
@NODE LoDi "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `LoDi:' Command."
	The `LoDi:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command the
lowest number of @{" standard-upload-file-listing directories " LINK Dir_S} to search
in. For this reason it should always be placed before the `Check' command
in the script.
	This command can be used in conjunction with the @{" `HiDi' " LINK HiDi} command
in order to specify the range of Directories to be Checked.

	The `LoDi:' command requires an decimal-number argument of one or
two digits (i.e. any number from 0 to 99). The number that you give to it
is the lowest dir that dupecheck should search in.

For example, if in your conference directory there are five dir files,
"Dir1", "Dir2", "Dir3", "Dir4", and "Dir5"

LoDi: 6
; Above will not check any of the dirs.

LoDi: 3
; Above will check "Dir3", "Dir4", and "Dir5"

LoDi: 0
; Above will check "Dir1", "Dir2", "Dir3", "Dir4", and "Dir5"


	If you leave the `LoDi:' command out of the script entirely a
default of "0" will be set, which means that first dir to be checked
will be "Dir1".

	You can tell the program the exact path of one or more dir-files to
be checked using the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command.


	If the `LoDi:' and @{" `HiDi:' " LINK HiDi} commands are not flexible enough
for you (for example, you may want to check Dir3 and Dir5, but not Dir4)
you are able to set both of them to 0 (zero) (which on its own would mean
that NONE of the dirs in the current conference would be checked), and then
use the @{" `DirF:' " LINK DirF} command to make only Dir3 and Dir5 be checked.
@ENDNODE
@NODE DirF "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `DirF:' Command."
	The `DirF:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command to look
at the directory file given to it as an argument and check for dupes
in it as it would do any other file.
	This allows you to easily specify directory files which are not
part of the standard dir1, dir2, etc files found in the current conference.
The main uses of this command are to specify offline directories (similar
to using a @{" Dupe-Directory " LINK Dir_D}, but you can give the exact path), and to
tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command to check directories from other conferences. This
means that it is possible for you to have, say, an AmiExpress utils conf,
and ensure that once a util has been uploaded into it, noone can upload the
same file into your main Amiga conference because the SDupeCheck.cfg in the
Amiga conference makes Super-DupeCheck look at the file listings in the
utils conference.
	In some ways, this command performs the same purpose as the
@{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G} - however, it is MUCH more flexible and easy to use
(you don't have to keep updating one global file as the actual conference
dirs can be checked themselves). The command makes the @{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G}
somewhat obsolete, and the @{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G} has only been left in just
in case somebody out there has some kind of use for it.


	The `DirF:' command requires the full path to a valid AmiExpress
directory listing file be given as its argument. If you would like more
than one file checked (remember these files are in addition to the
@{" Dupe-Directory " LINK Dir_D}, the @{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G}, and the @{" Standard Directories " LINK Dir_S})
you should use the `DirF:' command more than once.
	Please note that you MUST have all `DirF:' commands BEFORE the
@{" `Check' " LINK Check} command.

For Example:

Glob: Y
LoDi: 1
HiDi: 10
DirF: BBS:Utils/Dir1
DirF: BBS:Utils/Dir2
DirF: BBS:Huge_Dir
Check U

The above would perform a dupecheck (which would assume that all of the
directory files have U-pper case filenames) on all of the
@{" Standard Directories " LINK Dir_S} in the conference between Dir1 and Dir10, on
the @{" Dupe-Directory " LINK Dir_D} (if it exists), and on the @{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G} (if it
exists). In addition to checking those files, the dupecheck would also
check "BBS:Utils/Dir1", "BBS:Utils/Dir2", and "BBS:Huge_Dir".


	You can change the range of dirs checked in the current conference
using the @{" `LoDi:' " LINK LoDi} and @{" `HiDi:' " LINK HiDi} commands, and you can tell the program
whether or not to use the @{" Global-Dupe-Dir " LINK Dir_G} (if there is one) by using
the @{" `Glob:' " LINK Glob} command.

	If the @{" `LoDi:' " LINK LoDi} and @{" `HiDi:' " LINK HiDi} commands are not flexible enough
for you (for example, you may want to check Dir3 and Dir5, but not Dir4)
you are able to set both of them to 0 (zero) (which on its own would mean
that NONE of the dirs in the current conference would be checked), and then
use the `DirF:' command to make only Dir3 and Dir5 be checked.
	For example, if the path to the conference is "BBS:Stuff/":

LoDi: 0
HiDi: 0
DirF: BBS:Stuff/Dir3
DirF: BBS:Stuff/Dir5
Check U

	Would do the trick. Remember that the config file can be placed
in individual conferences so that they each have their own special
configuration. (See @{" Where to put it. " LINK PutIt})
@ENDNODE
@NODE Name "Super-DupeCheck: The Config File - The `Name:' Command."
	The `Name:' command is used to tell the @{" `Check' " LINK Check} command to skip
the actual dupecheck itself if the uploader has the name given to it as an
argument. For this reason you must place the `Name:' command before the
`Check' command in the config file.

	The `Name:' command requires a username be given as its argument.
The name is *NOT* case sensitive, "P0T-NOODLE" is the same as "p0t-noodle".
If you want to have dupechecking skipped for more than one named person you
should just have more than one `Name:' command.

For Example:

Name: Dream Warrior
Name: DreamScape
Name: DreamMaster
Check U

The if the user's name is either "Dream Warrior", "DreamScape", or "Dream
Master" the `Check' routine will not waste their time perforsing 
 dupecheckmand willautomratcuallyp ast the filn. Aall other commands fster the `Check'WILLe beruen asnNormat).

	If you leave this command out of the script file ell oghethernon
