Right - because of how old all of this stuff is, some of it could need
some playing around with to get it to assemble with the newer routines
and includes files. Don't expect any of it to be easy!!

I hasten to add that the programs I'm writing at the moment are a lot
better coded than anything you'll find in this archive. It goes without
saying that you improve your coding with time, so please don't laugh if
you see some really stupid way of coding!! :-)


WARNING: Most of my AmiExpress utils have some simpl checksums in them to
         make sure some lame fuck doesn't change my name! Of course, if
         you're gunna update this stuff or play with my source, you're
         probably going to want to change the output texts and stuff.
         I SUGGEST YOU REMOVE THE CHECKSUM CODE FIRST! It isn't hard to
         remove, just find the routines which call the checksum macro near
         the start of the source. (If just remove the checksum macro and
         attempt to assemble you should get told which routines are looking
         for it!).

         If you stuff-up the checksum, the program will disable the FreeMem()
         call, and you'll gradually run out of memory (it doesn't do anything
         nasty to your harddrive, I'm not that big an asshole!).

         I thought I'd better warn you about that!


Another thing of note: Some of the programs use things like this:

DOS_CLIRITE = Y	Write text using CLI_Hdl(a5) as output handle.
DOS_FILEXIS = N	Check if a file exists. Also locks the file.
DOS_FILSIZE = Y	Measure size of a file.
DOS_FILALOC = N	Allocate Memory for file.
DOS_FILDALO = N	DeAllocate Memory for file.

while others will do it like this:

DOS_CLIRITE	; Write text using CLI_Hdl(a5) as output handle.
DOS_FILSIZE	; Measure size of a file.

You should convert everything to use the SECOND method (i.e., all lines
with "= Y", you can leave included, but if they say "= N" you can remove
them).

These things are used to set options and control whether bits of code from
other files get included at assembly time. Check out the Routines/ files
to see what I mean.


Good luck getting this stuff to assemble! I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
If you have trouble, please try to contact me and I'll attempt to help you
out.

	Leo.
