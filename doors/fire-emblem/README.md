## Combat Mechanics

### Weapon Triangle

```
Sword → Axe → Lance → Sword
  ↓      ↓      ↓
 +15    +15    +15   (Hit and Avoid)
```

Advantage also activates **Break** - prevents counterattack!

### Stats Explained

- **HP** - Hit Points, unit dies at 0
- **Str** - Strength, physical damage
- **Mag** - Magic, magical damage
- **Skl** - Skill, affects hit rate and criticals
- **Spd** - Speed, affects avoid and double attacks
- **Lck** - Luck, affects all calculations slightly
- **Def** - Defense, reduces physical damage
- **Res** - Resistance, reduces magical damage
- **Mov** - Movement range per turn

### Hit Rate Calculation

```
Hit% = Weapon Hit + (Skill × 2) + Luck
     - (Enemy Speed × 2) - Enemy Luck
     + Weapon Triangle Bonus
     + Terrain Bonus
```

### Damage Calculation

```
Damage = Weapon Might + Attack Stat - Defense Stat
       + Weapon Triangle Bonus
```

### Critical Hit

```
Crit% = Weapon Crit + (Skill ÷ 2) - Enemy Luck
Critical Damage = Damage × 3
```

### Double Attack

```
If (Attacker Speed - Defender Speed) ≥ 4:
  Attacker attacks twice
```

### Experience & Leveling

```
Base Exp = 10
+ Level Difference Bonus
+ 30 for defeating enemy
+ 40 for defeating with final blow

Level Up: Random stat increases based on Growth Rates
```

## Growth Rates

Each unit has percentage chances to increase stats on level up:

**Example: Aldric (Lord)**
- HP: 80% - Str: 40% - Mag: 5% - Skl: 50%
- Spd: 50% - Lck: 60% - Def: 30% - Res: 25%

Higher growth rates = more likely to increase that stat!

## Class Promotion

- Promote at **Level 10+** (varies by class)
- Gain **stat bonuses** immediately
- Access to **new weapons**
- Learn **advanced skills**
- Increased **stat caps**

Example: Myrmidon → Swordmaster
- +2 HP, +1 Str, +2 Skl, +3 Spd, +1 Lck, +1 Def, +1 Res, +1 Mov
- Learns: Astra (5 hits at 50% damage)
- Learns: Swordfaire (+5 damage with swords)
