# Directory Structure Reorganization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Foundation Laid

---

## Executive Summary

The project has been analyzed against a real AmiExpress BBS (SanctuaryBBS) and reorganized to match authentic BBS directory structure while maintaining modern web application functionality.

### What Was Done ✅

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Analyzed SanctuaryBBS (real AmiExpress BBS) directory structure
   - Documented differences between authentic BBS and current project
   - Created detailed comparison and reorganization plans

2. **Critical Missing Directory Created**
   - Created `Screens/` directory at root level
   - Added subdirectories: `flt/`, `logoff/`, `custom/`
   - Added README.md explaining purpose and structure

3. **Conference Standardization**
   - Standardized all 14 conference directories (Conf1-Conf14)
   - Each conference now has proper subdirectory structure:
     - `Bulletins/` - Conference-specific bulletins
     - `MsgBase/` - Message database files
     - `Hold/` - Held messages
     - `Upload/` - Uploaded files directory
     - `PartUpload/` - Partial uploads directory
     - `LCFiles/` - Last callers files
     - `Dir0/`, `Dir1/`, `Dir2/` - File area directories
   - Added standard files to each conference:
     - `Menu.txt` - Conference menu
     - `downloadmsg.txt` - Download message template
     - `uploadmsg.txt` - Upload message template
     - `NDIRS` - Number of directories file

4. **Documentation Created**
   - `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed comparison
   - `REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` - Step-by-step migration guide
   - `Screens/README.md` - Documentation for Screens directory
   - `Scripts/standardize-conferences.sh` - Automation script

## Changes Made in Detail

### 1. Screens Directory (NEW)
**Location:** `/Screens/`

**Structure:**
```
Screens/
├── README.md            # Documentation
├── flt/                 # File listing templates
├── logoff/              # Logoff screens
└── custom/              # Custom themed screens
```

**Purpose:** Central location for display screens, ANSI art, and templates used throughout the BBS. This matches the authentic AmiExpress structure where all display content is centralized.

### 2. Conference Standardization (UPDATED)
**Location:** `/Conf1/` through `/Conf14/`

**Before:**
- Inconsistent subdirectories
- Missing standard directories
- No standard files

**After:**
All conferences now have:
```
ConfX/
├── Bulletins/           # Conference bulletins
├── MsgBase/             # Message storage
├── Hold/                # Held messages
├── Upload/              # Upload directory
├── PartUpload/          # Partial uploads
├── LCFiles/             # Last callers
├── Dir0/, Dir1/, Dir2/  # File areas
├── Conf.DB              # Database file
├── Menu.txt             # Menu text
├── downloadmsg.txt      # Download template
├── uploadmsg.txt        # Upload template
└── NDIRS                # Directory count
```

### 3. Automation Script Created
**Location:** `/Scripts/standardize-conferences.sh`

**Purpose:** Automated script to standardize all conference directories. Can be run again if needed to ensure consistency or set up new conferences.

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x Scripts/standardize-conferences.sh
./Scripts/standardize-conferences.sh
```

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Phase 2: Documentation Migration (Low Risk)
- Move `Docs/` → `dev/docs/`
- Update documentation references
- Keep working copies during transition

### Phase 3: Scripts Migration (Medium Risk)
- Move `Scripts/` → `dev/scripts/`
- Update package.json references
- Test all scripts from new location

### Phase 4: Web Components Reorganization (High Risk)
- Create `web/` container directory
- Move modern web components:
  - `backend/` → `web/backend/`
  - `frontend/` → `web/frontend/`
  - `client/` → `web/client/`
  - `server/` → `web/server/`
- Update all path references
- Test thoroughly before committing

### Phase 5: Cleanup (Low Risk)
- Move `unlzx/` → `dev/tools/unlzx/`
- Archive old directories
- Clean up temporary files

---

## Benefits Achieved

## Technical Details

### Conference Directory Structure
Each conference follows this exact pattern:
- **Bulletins/** - Text files displayed as bulletins
- **MsgBase/** - Contains message headers and data
- **Hold/** - Messages on hold for review
- **Upload/** - Staging area for uploaded files
- **PartUpload/** - Incomplete uploads
- **LCFiles/** - Last caller information
- **Dir0-2/** - Three file area directories
- **Conf.DB** - Conference configuration database
- **Menu.txt** - User menu display
- **downloadmsg.txt** - Message shown during downloads
- **uploadmsg.txt** - Message shown during uploads
- **NDIRS** - File containing number of directories (3)

### Screens Directory Purpose
The Screens directory centralizes all display content:
- **flt/** - File listing templates (FLT = File LisTing)
- **logoff/** - Goodbye screens shown when users disconnect
- **custom/** - Custom ANSI art and themed screens

Files can have `.txt` (plain) or `.txt.gr` (graphics/ANSI) extensions.

---

## Testing and Verification

### ✅ Completed Tests
- Conference directory creation verified
- Standard files created successfully
- Directory structure matches SanctuaryBBS
- Automation script tested on all 14 conferences

### ⏳ Pending Tests (for future phases)
- Backend path resolution
- Frontend connectivity
- Database access from new locations
- File upload/download functionality
- Door execution
- Message system
- User authentication

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (Done ✅)
1. ✅ Create Screens directory
2. ✅ Standardize conference structures
3. ✅ Document changes

### NEXT STEPS (Phase 2)
1. Review this documentation with stakeholders
2. Decide on timing for web component reorganization
3. Create backup/branch before Phase 4
4. Consider using symlink approach for gradual migration

### FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
1. Add example screens to Screens/ subdirectories
2. Create conference configuration templates
3. Document BBS configuration process
4. Consider creating setup wizard

---

## Migration Safety

### What's Safe Now ✅
- All changes made are **additive only**
- No existing files moved or deleted
- No path changes to existing code
- System remains fully functional

### What Needs Caution ⚠️
- Future web component migration (Phase 4)
- Path updates in configuration files
- Testing required after each phase
- Backup before major changes
