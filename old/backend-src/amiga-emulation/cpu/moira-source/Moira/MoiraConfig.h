/* Set to true to enable precise timing mode (68000 and 68010 only).
 *
 * When disabled, Moira calls the 'sync' function at the end of each instruction,
 * passing the number of elapsed cycles as an argument. In precise timing mode,
 * 'sync' is called before each memory access, allowing the client to emulate
 * the surrounding hardware up to the point where the memory access occurs.
 *
 * Precise timing mode is available only for 68000 and 68010 emulation. For
 * other supported models, this setting has no effect.
 *
 * Enable to improve accuracy, disable it to enhance performance.

 * the standard object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. However, virtual
