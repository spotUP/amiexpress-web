# Deployment Webhook Notifications

Get notified in Discord or Slack when your BBS is deployed!

## What You'll Get

Automatic notifications for:
- üöÄ **Deployment Started** - When deployment begins
- ‚úÖ **Backend Deployed** - When backend is live on Render
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Deployed** - When frontend is live on Vercel
- üéâ **Deployment Complete** - Final success summary

## Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Webhook URL

**For Discord:**
1. Open Discord server ‚Üí Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click "New Webhook"
3. Name it "Deployments" (or whatever you want)
4. Select the channel for notifications
5. Copy the webhook URL

**For Slack:**
1. Go to your workspace ‚Üí Settings & administration ‚Üí Manage apps
2. Search for "Incoming Webhooks" ‚Üí Add to Slack
3. Choose channel ‚Üí Copy webhook URL

### Step 2: Add to .env.local File

Add the webhook URL to your `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Create .env.local if it doesn't exist
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your webhook URL
DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Important:** The `.env.local` file is in `.gitignore` so your webhook URL stays private.

**Alternative - Environment Variable:**

If you prefer, you can also set it as a shell environment variable:
```bash
export DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL="your-webhook-url"
```

The script will check `.env.local` first, then fall back to the environment variable.

### Step 3: Deploy!

Just run your normal deployment command:

```bash
./Scripts/deployment/deploy.sh
```

You'll now get notifications in Discord/Slack! üéâ

## Disable Notifications

**Option 1 - Remove from .env.local:**
```bash
# Edit .env.local and remove or comment out the line:
# DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL=
```

**Option 2 - Unset environment variable:**

## Multiple Webhooks

Want notifications in multiple channels? Create a script wrapper:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-notify-all.sh

# Send to Discord
export DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/abc"
./Scripts/deployment/deploy.sh

# Send to Slack (future deployments)
# export DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00/B00/XXX"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving notifications?

1. **Check the .env.local file:**
   ```bash
   grep DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL .env.local
   ```
   Should show your webhook URL.

2. **Check the environment variable (if not using .env.local):**
   ```bash
   echo $DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```
   Should print your webhook URL.

3. **Test the webhook manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "$DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Test notification"}'
   ```

3. **Check webhook is still active:**
   - Discord: Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Slack: Check the webhook URL is still valid

### Notifications not formatted correctly?

- Make sure your webhook URL is complete
- Discord URLs start with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- Slack URLs start with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`

## Advanced: Customize Notifications

Edit the `send_webhook()` function in `Scripts/deployment/deploy.sh` to customize:
- Colors (Discord embeds)
- Emojis
- Message format
- Additional fields

## Why This Is Useful

- **Monitor deployments remotely** - No need to watch terminal
- **Team coordination** - Everyone knows when updates go live
- **Deployment history** - See what was deployed and when
- **Quick access** - Links to backend and frontend in notifications
- **Status at a glance** - Green = success, color-coded messages

## Security Note

Webhook URLs allow anyone to send messages to your channel. Keep them private:
- ‚úÖ Store in `.env.local` file (already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚ùå Never commit webhook URLs to git
- ‚ùå Don't share webhook URLs publicly
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` for documentation (without actual URLs)
