# bcrypt Password Migration - Complete ✅

**Status:** PRODUCTION READY
**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Security Level:** Industry Standard

---

## Executive Summary

The AmiExpress-Web BBS has been **fully migrated from SHA-256 to bcrypt** password hashing with automatic transparent upgrading of legacy passwords. This addresses the critical security vulnerability identified in the MASTER_PLAN.md.

### What Changed

- ✅ **New passwords** hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ **Legacy SHA-256 passwords** still work during login
- ✅ **Automatic upgrade** to bcrypt on successful login
- ✅ **No user action required** - migration is transparent

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Password Hashing (database.ts)

**File:** `/backend/src/database.ts`

```typescript
async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
  // Use bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (industry standard for security)
  const saltRounds = 12;
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
}
```

**Security Features:**
- 12 salt rounds (~300ms per hash - perfect for security vs performance)
- Unique salt per password
- Industry-standard bcrypt algorithm
- Future-proof (can increase rounds as CPUs get faster)

### 2. Password Verification (database.ts)

**File:** `/backend/src/database.ts`

```typescript
async verifyPassword(password: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Check if this is a legacy SHA-256 hash (64 hex characters)
  const isSHA256 = hash.length === 64 && /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i.test(hash);

  if (isSHA256) {
    // Legacy SHA-256 hash - use direct comparison
    const sha256Hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password).digest('hex');
    return sha256Hash === hash;
  }

  // Modern bcrypt hash - use bcrypt.compare()
  try {
    return await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
  } catch (error) {
    // If bcrypt verification fails due to invalid hash format, return false
    console.warn('Password verification error:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. Detects hash type by length and format
2. SHA-256 hashes: 64 hex characters → Direct comparison
3. bcrypt hashes: ~60 characters starting with `$2b$` → bcrypt.compare()
4. Invalid hashes: Returns false

### 3. Automatic Password Upgrade (index.ts)

**File:** `/backend/src/index.ts` (lines 573-579)

```typescript
// Transparent password migration: upgrade legacy SHA-256 hashes to bcrypt
if (user.passwordHash.length === 64) { // SHA-256 hashes are always 64 hex characters
  console.log('Step 3a: Migrating legacy password to bcrypt...');
  const newHash = await db.hashPassword(data.password);
  await db.updateUser(user.id, { passwordHash: newHash });
  console.log('Step 3a: Password upgraded to bcrypt successfully');
}
```

**User Experience:**
- User logs in with old password
- System verifies using SHA-256 (legacy)
- If valid, upgrades hash to bcrypt in database
- Next login uses bcrypt
- **Zero disruption to users!**

### 4. New User Registration (index.ts)

**File:** `/backend/src/index.ts` (line 655)

```typescript
// Hash password
const passwordHash = await db.hashPassword(data.password);
```

All new users automatically get bcrypt hashes from day one.

## Security Analysis

### Before (SHA-256)
- ❌ Fast hashing (~0.01ms per hash)
- ❌ No salt (rainbow table attacks possible)
- ❌ GPU cracking (billions of hashes/sec)
- ❌ Not designed for password storage

### After (bcrypt)
- ✅ Slow hashing (~300ms per hash)
- ✅ Unique salt per password
- ✅ GPU-resistant design
- ✅ Purpose-built for password storage
- ✅ Configurable work factor (12 rounds)

### Attack Resistance

**SHA-256 (old):**
- Modern GPU: ~10 billion hashes/second
- 8-character password: **Crackable in minutes**

**bcrypt (new):**
- Modern GPU: ~100,000 hashes/second
- 8-character password: **Crackable in years**
- 12-character password: **Practically uncrackable**

## Migration Process

### For Existing Users

1. **Before First Login (Legacy)**
   ```
   User record:
   - username: "johndoe"
   - passwordHash: "ffc121a2210958bf74e5a874668f..." (64 chars, SHA-256)
   ```

2. **During Login**
   - User enters password
   - System detects SHA-256 hash (64 hex characters)
   - Verifies using SHA-256 comparison
   - If valid, immediately upgrades to bcrypt
   - Updates database with new bcrypt hash

3. **After First Login (Upgraded)**
   ```
   User record:
   - username: "johndoe"
   - passwordHash: "$2b$12$NN69vr6t00FbH5..." (60 chars, bcrypt)
   ```

4. **Subsequent Logins**
   - System detects bcrypt hash
   - Uses bcrypt.compare() for verification
   - No migration needed

### For New Users

- Registration immediately creates bcrypt hash
- No migration needed
- Secure from day one

---

## Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Completed

- [x] bcrypt package installed (`package.json`)
- [x] hashPassword() uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
- [x] verifyPassword() supports both hash types
- [x] Automatic password upgrade on login
- [x] New user registration uses bcrypt
- [x] Comprehensive test suite created
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete

### 🚀 Ready for Production

**No action required!** The migration is:
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Transparent to users
- ✅ Already deployed in code
- ✅ Fully tested

---

## Performance Impact

### Hash Generation (Registration, Password Reset)
- **Before:** ~0.01ms per hash
- **After:** ~300ms per hash
- **Impact:** Negligible (only during registration/password reset)
- **Benefit:** Massive security improvement

### Hash Verification (Login)
- **Before:** ~0.01ms per verification
- **After:** ~300ms per verification
- **Impact:** ~300ms added to login time
- **Mitigation:**
  - Only affects login (not frequent)
  - Users expect ~0.5s login time anyway
  - Far outweighed by security benefit

### Database Impact
- **Hash storage:** 60 bytes (bcrypt) vs 64 bytes (SHA-256)
- **Net change:** Slightly smaller
- **Impact:** None

---

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators

Monitor these metrics after deployment:

1. **Hash Distribution**
   ```sql
   -- Count legacy vs bcrypt hashes
   SELECT
     CASE
       WHEN LENGTH(passwordhash) = 64 THEN 'SHA-256 (legacy)'
       WHEN LENGTH(passwordhash) = 60 THEN 'bcrypt'
       ELSE 'unknown'
     END as hash_type,
     COUNT(*) as count
   FROM users
   GROUP BY hash_type;
   ```

2. **Migration Progress**
   - Track % of users upgraded to bcrypt
   - Should approach 100% as users log in
   - Legacy hashes only for inactive users

3. **Login Performance**
   - Measure average login time
   - Should be ~300-400ms (acceptable)
   - No timeout issues expected

### Logging

Look for these log messages:

**Successful Legacy Upgrade:**
```
Step 3a: Migrating legacy password to bcrypt...
Step 3a: Password upgraded to bcrypt successfully
```

**Normal bcrypt Login:**
```
Step 3: Verifying password...
Step 3 result: Password valid = true
Login successful for user: johndoe
```

## Maintenance

### Increasing Work Factor

As CPUs get faster, you can increase the work factor:

```typescript
// In database.ts, line 1687
const saltRounds = 12; // Current

// Future:
const saltRounds = 13; // ~600ms per hash
const saltRounds = 14; // ~1200ms per hash
```

**When to increase:**
- When 12 rounds takes < 250ms on your server
- When security standards recommend it
- Typically every 2-3 years

**Migration:**
- Old hashes still verify correctly
- New hashes use new work factor
- Users auto-upgrade on next login

### Cleaning Up Legacy Hashes

After 6-12 months, you can:

1. **Identify inactive users:**
   ```sql
   SELECT username, lastlogin
   FROM users
   WHERE LENGTH(passwordhash) = 64
   AND (lastlogin < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months' OR lastlogin IS NULL);
   ```

2. **Options:**
   - Force password reset on next login
   - Send email reminder to log in
   - Archive inactive accounts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User can't log in after migration

**Symptoms:**
- User reports "Invalid password"
- Password worked before

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
SELECT username, LENGTH(passwordhash) as hash_length, passwordhash
FROM users
WHERE username = 'problematic_user';
```

**Solutions:**
1. If hash length = 64: User has legacy hash, should still work
2. If hash length = 60: User has bcrypt hash, password may have changed
3. Check logs for verification errors
4. Reset password if needed

### Issue: Slow login times

**Symptoms:**
- Login takes > 1 second
- Users complaining about performance

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
// Add timing to login (index.ts)
const verifyStart = Date.now();
const isValidPassword = await db.verifyPassword(data.password, user.passwordHash);
console.log(`Password verification took: ${Date.now() - verifyStart}ms`);
```

**Solutions:**
1. If > 500ms: Consider reducing to 11 salt rounds
2. Check server CPU usage
3. Verify not running in debug mode

### Issue: Hash type detection failing

**Symptoms:**
- Legacy passwords not upgrading
- Verification errors

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
// Test hash detection
const hash = user.passwordHash;
const isSHA256 = hash.length === 64 && /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i.test(hash);
console.log(`Hash: ${hash}`);
console.log(`Length: ${hash.length}`);
console.log(`Is SHA-256: ${isSHA256}`);
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify hash format in database
2. Check for whitespace/newlines
3. Verify regex pattern matches
