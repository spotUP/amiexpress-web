Ami-Express is a host Bulletin Board software program, allowing the transfer of data, between host and remote terminals via telnet or traditionally a telephone link. ( Obvious to some!! ). This data can be files uploaded or downloaded from remote (user end) from the BBS databases. Most Bulletin boards also contain message bases where you can read and leave electronic mail to other users. It is possible via some BBS`s to play on-line games, although these are of a simple nature, they can still be quite entertaining. For those of you that have been a user, either host or remote, for some time, will have noticed the major changes that Ami-Express has undergone. I am trying to make Ami-Express the best it can be and to include as many features as I can while retaining the look and feel that users of the system have become familiar.
