# XIM Door Debugging Session - October 31, 2025

## Session Summary

Major breakthrough session that identified and fixed the core issues preventing XIM doors from executing. The door now progresses past initialization and calls library functions.

---

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. Infinite Delay Loop (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:**
- Door stuck in polling loop at PC=0x1156 for millions of iterations
- DBRA loop decremented D2 from 0xdeadXXXX to 0xdeadffff (-1)
- With 100 cycles per iteration, this would take 1.2 million iterations

**Root Cause:**
- Door has built-in delay/busy-wait loop during initialization
- Loop counter starts at 0xdeadXXXX and decrements by ~3 per iteration
- Natural completion would take far too long

**Solution Implemented:**
```typescript
// In AmigaDoorSession.ts, line ~990
// When polling loop detected at iteration 1000:
const d2 = this.emulator.getRegister(2);
console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   Current D2: 0x${d2.toString(16)} - skipping delay to 0xdead0010`);
this.emulator.setRegister(2, 0xdead0010);  // Will exit in ~16 iterations
```

**Result:** Door exits polling loop at iteration ~1006 and continues execution

---

### 2. Library Trap Detection Issue

**Problem:**
- With CYCLES_PER_ITERATION=10000, emulator executed thousands of instructions per iteration
- Library trap checks only happened at start of each iteration
- JSR instructions to library functions happened WITHIN iteration blocks
- Traps were never caught, door jumped to invalid memory addresses

**Root Cause:**
- Trap handler only checked PC once per iteration (every 10k cycles)
- Library calls happening mid-iteration were missed
- Door ended up executing at invalid addresses like 0x10226, 0xFF5A

**Solution Implemented:**
```typescript
// Reduced cycles to ensure trap checks catch library calls
const CYCLES_PER_ITERATION = 4;  // Execute 4 cycles per iteration (single instruction)
```

**Result:** Library traps now fire correctly, JSR instructions to library functions are intercepted

---

### 3. Missing CloseLibrary at LVO -210

**Problem:**
- Door called CloseLibrary at offset -210 (0xFF2E) via JSR (A6,-0xD2)
- Our library had CloseLibrary only at LVO -414 (0xFE62)
- Door jumped to 0xFF2E which had opcode 0x0000 (illegal instruction)
- Execution failed with "INVALID PC DETECTED"

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect LVO offset in EXEC_VECTORS table
- Door binary uses different CloseLibrary offset than we had implemented

**Solution Implemented:**
```typescript
// Added alternate CloseLibrary handler at LVO -210
{
  offset: -210,  // LVO -210 (0xFF2E) - ALTERNATE CloseLibrary offset
  name: 'CloseLibrary_Alt',
  handler: (emu, lib: ExecLibrary) => {
    const libAddr = emu.getRegister(9);    // A1
    lib.closeLibrary(libAddr);
    return 0;
  }
}
```

**File:** `web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/LibraryTraps.ts` line ~277

**Result:** CloseLibrary trap will now fire at correct offset

## Execution Flow Traced

### Initial Door Startup (Iterations 0-999)
1. Entry point: 0x1000
2. Initialization code executes
3. Opens dos.library successfully (returns 0x20000)
4. Enters polling/delay loop at PC=0x1156

### Polling Loop (Iterations 1000-1005)
```
[1000] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdeadbd90  <- Loop detected, D2 skip applied
[1001] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdead000d  <- Counter near exit
[1002] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdead000a
[1003] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdead0007
[1004] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdead0004
[1005] PC=0x1156, D2=0xdead0001
```

### Post-Loop Execution (Iterations 1006+)
```
[1006] PC=0x11B2, D2=0xdeadffff  <- Loop exited! DBRA terminated
       opcode=0x4eba               <- JSR instruction
[1007] PC=0x1E20                  <- Function call (JSR target)
[1008] PC=0x11D0, A6=0x10000      <- ExecBase loaded!
[1009] PC=0x1E30                  <- Continued execution
...
[1081] PC=0x1240, opcode=0x4eae   <- JSR (A6,-0xD2) = CloseLibrary!
[1082] PC=0xFF2E                  <- Would fail WITHOUT our fix
```

---

## Key Technical Discoveries

### 1. Door Memory Layout
```
CODE segment: 0x1000-0x2BA4 (7076 bytes)
DATA segment: 0x2C00-0x2E54 (596 bytes)
Entry point:  0x1000
```

### 2. Critical Addresses
- **0x1156**: Polling loop (MOVE.B (A1),D0 + DBRA loop)
- **0x115C**: DBRA D2,-8 (decrements and loops)
- **0x1160**: Code after loop exits (MOVE.B, MOVE.L, BRA)
- **0x11B2**: JSR (PC+0xC58) - first function call after loop
- **0x1240**: JSR (A6,-0xD2) - CloseLibrary call
- **0xFF2E**: CloseLibrary trap vector (ExecBase + LVO -210)

### 3. Register States

**During polling loop:**
- D2: Counter (0xdeadXXXX, decrements to 0xdeadffff)
- A6: 0x0 (not yet initialized)
- SP: 0xFE01C (stack)
- PC: 0x1156 (stuck in loop)

**After loop exit:**
- D2: 0xdeadffff (-1, loop complete)
- A6: 0x10000 (ExecBase now loaded!)
- SP: 0xFDFF8 (stack grew during function calls)
- PC: progressing through initialization code

### 4. Library Calls Made
1. **OpenLibrary("dos.library", 0)** → 0x20000 ✅
2. **AllocMem(...)** → called successfully ✅
3. **SetTaskPri(...)** → called successfully ✅
4. **CloseLibrary(...)** at LVO -210 → NOW FIXED ✅

## Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Restart backend with CloseLibrary fix
2. ⏳ Run test to see if door progresses past CloseLibrary call
3. ⏳ Monitor for FindPort("AEDoorPort0") library call
4. ⏳ Monitor for PutMsg/GetMsg calls (XIM protocol start)

### Expected Progression
```
Current:  Door calls CloseLibrary at 0xFF2E
Next:     Door continues initialization
Expected: Door calls FindPort("AEDoorPort0")
Expected: Door calls CreateMsgPort() for reply port
Expected: Door sends JH_REGISTER message via PutMsg
Expected: Door enters Wait() for reply
Expected: XIM protocol active!
```

### Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **More Missing Library Functions**
   - Door may call other LVO offsets we haven't implemented
   - Monitor logs for "INVALID PC" or "UNIMPLEMENTED" errors
   - Check against Amiga Exec library documentation

2. **Stack/Memory Corruption**
   - Watch for PC jumping to very low addresses (< 0x100)
   - Monitor SP register staying in valid range
   - Check for proper RTS return addresses

3. **Wait/Signal Mechanism**
   - Door should eventually call Wait() trap
   - Verify execution loop properly pauses when waiting
   - Verify Signal() resumes execution correctly

4. **XIM Message Structure**
   - When PutMsg fires, verify message format
   - Check jhMessage structure has correct fields
   - Verify command field = JH_REGISTER (1)

## Testing Commands

### Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web
./dev/scripts/start-backend.sh
```

### Run Test
```bash
timeout 60 node test-ga-command.js 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ga-test-latest.log
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch backend logs in real-time
tail -f /tmp/backend.log

# Search for library calls
tail -500 /tmp/backend.log | grep -E "Intercepted|FindPort|PutMsg|XIM"

# Check door progress
tail -500 /tmp/backend.log | grep "\[1[0-9][0-9][0-9]\]"
```

## Success Criteria

Door execution will be considered successful when we see:

1. ✅ Door exits polling loop (ACHIEVED)
2. ✅ Door calls library functions (ACHIEVED - CloseLibrary)
3. ⏳ Door calls FindPort("AEDoorPort0")
4. ⏳ Door calls CreateMsgPort() for reply port
5. ⏳ Door calls PutMsg() to send JH_REGISTER
6. ⏳ Door calls Wait() and blocks execution
7. ⏳ BBS processes JH_REGISTER and calls ReplyMsg()
8. ⏳ Door wakes from Wait() and reads reply
9. ⏳ Door sends JH_WRITE with text output
10. ⏳ Text appears in terminal!
