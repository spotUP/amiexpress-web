/**
 * The msgHeader record as a REAL AmiExpress board writes it.
 *
 * Not the same as `MessageIndexManager`'s, and that is the point. Both are
 * 110 bytes, but Amiga E aligns a LONG to an even offset, so the on-disk
 * record carries two pad bytes INSIDE it:
 *
 *   0    status      1 byte
 *   1    (pad)       1 byte   <- aligns msgNumb
 *   2    msgNumb     4 bytes, big-endian
 *   6    toName     31 bytes
 *   37   fromName   31 bytes
 *   68   subject    31 bytes
 *   99   (pad)       1 byte   <- aligns msgDate
 *   100  msgDate     4 bytes
 *   104  recv        4 bytes
 *   108  extMsgNum   2 bytes
 *                  = 110
 *
 * `MessageIndexManager` puts both pads at the END instead, which is
 * self-consistent - it writes and reads its own files - and unable to read a
 * board that AmiExpress wrote. Measured against the SanctuaryBBS reference
 * tree: with the pads at the end, message numbers all came back 0 and every
 * name was overlapped by the previous record's tail ("Hamletlund" for
 * "Hamlet", after "Tom Englund"). With them where they belong, the same file
 * reads as messages 1, 2, 3, 4 from Tom Englund, Hamlet, Sandman and Biotech,
 * dated through one evening in December 2017.
 *
 * This reader exists for IMPORT, where the bytes come from a real Amiga
 * board. The port's own message bases stay on the port's layout until someone
 * decides to migrate them, and that decision is not this file's to make.
