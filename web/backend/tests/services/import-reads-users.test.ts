/**
 * The importer reads a board's callers.
 *
 * It never had. `parseUserDataBinary` walked the fields from the 239-byte
 * struct listing in axobjects.e:11-68, at the 232-byte stride a door actually
 * uses (mtop.e - Amiga E alignment is why the two differ). Every record after
 * the first was skewed by seven bytes, and the LAST one ran past the end of
 * the file:
 *
 *   Error parsing user binary files: The value of "offset" is out of range.
 *   It must be >= 0 and <= 463. Received 464
 *
 * The catch swallowed it and returned an empty array, so the importer produced
 * ZERO users from every board it was ever pointed at - the one thing an
 * importer most has to do. Nothing caught it because nothing had run it
 * against a real board.
 *
 * The fixture is a genuine excerpt of the SanctuaryBBS reference tree in this
 * repo (Documentation/7-Reference Sources/SanctuaryBBS), copied byte for byte
 * rather than invented, because a fixture written from the same wrong
 * understanding as the code proves only that they agree. Its first record
 * annotates its own layout - `-------------30` after the name marks a 31-byte
 * field, and bytes 224-231 read `Padding` - which is independent confirmation
 * that a record ends at 232 and not at 239.
