/**
 * GA, L and SENT are unregistered, and stay unregistered.
 *
 * All three came off the SanctuaryBBS reference copy (`0b813fbcd`) and named
 * executables this board has never had:
 *
 *   Commands/BBSCmd/ga.info    LOCATION=Doors:GetAnswer/GetAnswer.030
 *   Commands/BBSCmd/L.info     LOCATION=doors:scan.x
 *   Commands/BBSCmd/SENT.info  LOCATION=DOORS:FILEID/FILEID
 *
 * They failed for EVERY caller on every terminal, not only at 40 columns - a
 * registration whose binary is absent is a command that answers with an error
 * and nothing else. The sysop's ruling on 2026-09-06 was to unregister all
 * three rather than repoint them, even though `Doors/GetAnswer/GetAnswer` and
 * `Doors/Fileid/FILEID.000` are sitting right beside the paths that were
 * wrong. Repointing is his call to make later; this file pins the ruling so a
 * fresh sync from the reference BBS cannot quietly bring them back.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a general "every LOCATION must exist" rule. A registration
 * may legitimately name a door that is installed on the board and absent from
 * git - `registration-matches-the-door.test.ts` says so and names TTT and
 * BestConf. This pins three specific commands the sysop retired.
