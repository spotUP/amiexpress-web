/**
 * "It asks for the BBS acronym on EVERY start." - the sysop, 2026-09-06.
 *
 * Two things, driven through the REAL 68K binary and the REAL emulator:
 *
 *   1. GWall asks for the BBS acronym ONCE, not on every start - including
 *      across the loss of the RAM disk, which is what a container restart is.
 *   2. The config it saves lands in the BBS env archive, spelled the way the
 *      door spelled it, and never loose in the BBS root.
 *
 * WHY IT REGRESSED. GWall persists its acronym the standard AmigaOS way:
 * `saveSettings()` writes ENV:GWall.cfg AND ENVARC:GWall.cfg
 * (`Documentation/7-Reference Sources/AmiXDoors-master/Global Wall/gwall.e:1697`)
 * and `readSettings()` reads ENV: back - because the Startup-Sequence copies
 * ENVARC: into ENV: at boot. We modelled only ENV:, and ENV: lives under
 * /tmp. The archive write had no assign at all, so it fell through
 * PathManager's unknown-volume fallback and became "<bbsRoot>/gwall.cfg" -
 * lowercased on the way, because that fallback took its remainder off the
 * lowercased copy of the path - which nothing ever reads. Captured before the
 * fix:
 *
 *   [PathManager] Volume fallback: "ENVARC:GWall.cfg"
 *       => "/Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web/gwall.cfg"
 *
 * Wipe /tmp - every deploy does - and the acronym was gone.
 *
 * WHY THE SECOND RUN IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. Run 1 on an unconfigured board
 * prompts before AND after the fix. The regression only shows up on the run
 * after that, with ENV: cleared and the archive intact: before the fix there
 * was nothing in the archive to come back from.
 *
 * NO SCRIPTED TYPING. The door writes its config to ENVARC: on its own, with
 * no input at all: readSettings() falling through calls saveSettings()
 * (gwall.e:1692) before the prompt is ever posted. That write is what these
 * cases follow, and it is deterministic - driving the JH_PM prompt from a
 * timed input script is not (measured 2026-09-06: identical scripts saved
 * "UPT" on one run and "T" on the next).
 *
 * NOTE ON GLC. The sysop named GLOBAL LAST CALLERS, but the prompt is
 * GWall's. `Doors/glc/glcviewer` contains no such string; the last case pins
 * that so a future reader does not go hunting in the wrong door.
