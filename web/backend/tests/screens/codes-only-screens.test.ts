/**
 * A screen that is nothing but codes is plumbing, not art.
 *
 * Asked for in those terms: "can we add filters so the user can select to
 * filter out screens with only codes and generated screens ... so the ansi
 * artists only see the screens they should touch".
 *
 * Measured on the live board when the rule was written: 400 files of art, 258
 * of pure codes, 5 empty and 6 the board writes itself. Eleven distinct screen
 * names account for all 258 - AWAITSCREEN is one code, LOGON10 is four
 * includes and a pause - and the art each of them PULLS IN is its own file,
 * which stays visible.
