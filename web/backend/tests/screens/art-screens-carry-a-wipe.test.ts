/**
 * Every artist-made screen the board serves opens with a screen wipe.
 *
 * The sysop's ask was "add the wipe command to all artist made screen files".
 * "Artist made" is not a judgement call here: the board already owns exactly
 * one art detector - `isAnsiArtScreen`, the screen-level policy the PETSCII
 * reflow uses to decide it must never smear an 80-column picture into 40
 * columns (utils/ansi-art-detect.util.ts: any absolute cursor motion, or
 * >= MIN_ART_ROWS art rows at more than ART_ROW_SHARE of the non-blank rows).
 * This test reuses it rather than growing a second classifier, so a screen
 * that counts as art for the C64 skip counts as art for the wipe too.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS. Every art screen under the locations the loader searches
 * (Screens, Conf<n>, Conf<n>'s Screens, Node<n> and Bulletins) must open with a `~W?` code that `parseWipeMCI` accepts - so a NEW art
 * screen dropped in without one fails here, by path, instead of quietly
 * painting instantly while every other screen wipes.
 *
 * WHY THE EXEMPTIONS. A wipe is not free anywhere. `displayScreen` is the
 * ONLY place `~W` is understood (handlers/screen.handler.ts:1951 -
 * `parseWipeMCI` runs on the top-level screen and nothing else strips the
 * code), so a screen that reaches the caller by any other route would print
 * the three characters `~WX` at the user. Each exemption below names that
 * route, and `EXEMPTIONS` is itself asserted: an entry that stops matching
 * any art screen on disk fails, so the table cannot rot into a blanket
 * "skip everything" once the files it describes are gone.
