# AmiExpress-Web Command Registry

**CRITICAL:** This file tracks ALL commands in the system to prevent accidental overwrites of original AmiExpress commands.

## 📋 Original AmiExpress Internal Commands (SACRED - DO NOT MODIFY)

These commands are from express.e (processInternalCommand function, lines 28283-28450). They are **UNTOUCHABLE** and must be implemented exactly as the original.

### Status Legend:
- ✅ **Implemented & Verified** - Command works exactly as express.e
- 🚧 **Partially Implemented** - Command exists but behavior may differ
- ❌ **Not Implemented** - Command missing entirely
- ⚠️ **BROKEN** - Command exists but does wrong thing

## 🆕 Custom Web Commands (Our Additions)

These commands are NOT in the original AmiExpress. They are custom additions for the web version and use non-conflicting names.

### Currently Defined Custom Commands:

| Command | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| *none* | | | **Phase 3: All reviewed and removed** |

**Note:** During Phase 3 review:
- `checkup`, `sal` - These are DOOR IDs, not commands (OK)
- `native`, `script`, `web` - These are DOOR TYPES, not commands (OK)
- `O_USERS` - Was a duplicate of WHO command (REMOVED in Phase 3)

### ⚠️ ATTENTION NEEDED:

The commands marked **REVIEW NEEDED** above were found in the current implementation but are NOT in express.e. We need to:

1. **Verify their purpose** - What do they do?
2. **Rename if needed** - Do they conflict with any original commands?
3. **Document or remove** - Are they necessary?

### Proposed Custom Commands (Not Yet Implemented):

When we need web-specific features, use these naming patterns:

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `WEB_*` | Web interface features | `WEB_SETTINGS`, `WEB_PROFILE` |
| `MODERN_*` | Modern enhancements | `MODERN_SEARCH`, `MODERN_UPLOAD` |
| `CUSTOM_*` | Custom additions | `CUSTOM_STATS`, `CUSTOM_TOOLS` |
| `ADMIN_*` | Administrative tools | `ADMIN_MONITOR`, `ADMIN_CONFIG` |

## 📝 Command Implementation Checklist

Before implementing ANY command:

1. **Check this registry** - Is it an original AmiExpress command?
2. **If original:**
   - Find it in express.e
   - Read the complete implementation
   - Implement EXACTLY as shown
   - Mark as ✅ when verified
3. **If custom:**
   - Use non-conflicting name (WEB_*, MODERN_*, etc.)
   - Document it in the "Custom Web Commands" section
   - Get user approval before implementing

---

## 🔍 Command Verification Protocol

To verify a command implementation:

1. **Find in express.e:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "internalCommand<X>" /Users/spot/Code/AmiExpress-Web/AmiExpress-Sources/express.e
   ```

2. **Read implementation:**
   ```bash
   sed -n '<line>,<line+50>p' /Users/spot/Code/AmiExpress-Web/AmiExpress-Sources/express.e
   ```

3. **Compare behavior** - Does our implementation match exactly?

4. **Update status** - Change ❌ → 🚧 → ✅
