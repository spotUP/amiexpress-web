# Session 2025-10-31: Conclusion and Recommendations

## Summary

After extensive debugging, we've identified multiple issues with the GetAnswer door execution:

1. **First delay loop**: Fixed by reducing iterations (3.7B → 100)
2. **Polling loop at PC=0x1156**: Door polls address 0x1 expecting quick exit
3. **A1=0x1**: Register points to near-NULL, not initialized properly
4. **Memory fix attempted**: Set mem[0x1]=0, but D0 still 0xffff
5. **Door crashes**: Jumps to 0x10226, executes garbage, SP corrupts to 0

---

## What We Implemented

✅ Wait() library function (LVO -318)
✅ Signal() library function (LVO -324)
✅ Comprehensive crash logging
✅ A1 register analysis
✅ Memory location fixes

---

## Root Cause

**GetAnswer door is fundamentally incompatible with our emulation environment.** The door makes assumptions about:
- Register initialization that we don't provide
- Memory layout that differs from our setup
- Timing/polling behavior that our emulator handles differently

---

## Recommendation: Test Simpler Door

Instead of continuing to debug GetAnswer (which may be buggy or require hardware we don't emulate), we should:

### 1. Test with example.e Door

The example.e door from AEDOORS uses AEDoor.library properly:
```e
IF aedoorbase:=OpenLibrary('AEDoor.library',1)
  diface:=CreateComm(arg[])
  WriteStr(diface,'Hello from door!',LF)
  DeleteComm(diface)
  CloseLibrary(aedoorbase)
ENDIF
```

This will test:
- OpenLibrary for AEDoor.library
- CreateComm communication
- WriteStr output
- Proper door lifecycle

### 2. Compile example.e

```bash
cd /Users/spot/Code/AmiExpress-Web/Docs/Doors_with_Source/AEDOORS/AmiExpress/Sources/
# Compile with E compiler or use pre-compiled version
```

### 3. Test with Our Emulator

Replace GetAnswer with example door, verify:
- Door opens AEDoor.library
- CreateComm sends JH_REGISTER message
- BBS receives and processes message
- WriteStr output appears

---

## If We Continue with GetAnswer

The next steps would be:

1. **Disassemble the entire door** - Understand every instruction
2. **Find ALL register initializations** - Where A1-A7, D0-D7 should be set
3. **Implement missing system structures** - Task structure fields door expects
4. **Consider the door might be broken** - Original binary could be corrupt

**Estimated effort**: 10+ more hours of deep assembly analysis

---

## Recommended Path Forward

**STOP debugging GetAnswer. Test with example.e instead.**

Reasons:
1. example.e is known-good code (from official AEDOORS package)
2. Uses AEDoor.library properly (tests our implementation)
3. Simple enough to debug if issues arise
4. Will validate our emulation architecture

If example.e works, we know our system is correct and GetAnswer is the problem.
If example.e fails, we know what specific AEDoor.library function to fix.

## Files Modified This Session

1. **ExecLibrary.ts**: Added wait() and signal() (+60 lines)
2. **LibraryTraps.ts**: Added Wait/Signal handlers (+20 lines)
3. **AmigaDoorSession.ts**: Added logging and memory fix (+50 lines)

---

## Conclusion

We've successfully:
- ✅ Implemented Wait() and Signal()
- ✅ Identified A1 register issue
- ✅ Traced complete crash sequence
- ✅ Attempted memory fixes

**Next session: Test with example.e door instead of GetAnswer.**

This will either validate our system works, or show us exactly what to fix.
