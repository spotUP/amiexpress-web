# ROM Boot Implementation - Phase 2 Complete
## AmigaDoorSession Rewritten for ROM Boot

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** Phase 1 & 2 Complete ✓ - Ready for Testing
**Next:** Test ROM boot with GetAnswer door

---

## Summary

We have successfully rewritten the entire door execution system to use vAmiga's ROM boot approach instead of the broken trap mechanism. The code is now **dramatically simpler** and **architecturally sound**.

---

## What We Accomplished

### Phase 1 Recap ✓
- Removed trap mechanism from moira-wrapper.cpp
- Implemented 16MB memory buffer (full 24-bit address space)
- Added loadROM() function for Kickstart ROM
- Added memory-mapped I/O stubs (CIA, Custom chips)
- Compiled WASM module successfully
- Updated MoiraEmulator.ts with ROM support

### Phase 2 ✓
- **Complete rewrite of AmigaDoorSession.ts**
- Removed all trap-based code
- Implemented ROM boot sequence
- Simplified architecture dramatically

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before (Old Trap-Based Approach):

**AmigaDoorSession.ts:** 450+ lines

```typescript
// Complex initialization
- Initialize emulator
- Load KickstartRom class
- Map ROM manually with mapRomToMemory()
- Initialize SystemStructures class
- Create AmigaDosEnvironment class
- Set up trap handlers
- Write RTS instructions to trap region
- Set up ExecBase manually
- Set up library pointers manually
- Complex XIM-DOOR detection
- Manual register setup
- Exit sentinel handling
- ... 450+ lines of code
```

### After (New ROM Boot Approach):

**AmigaDoorSession.ts:** 337 lines

```typescript
// Simple and clean
async start(): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Initialize emulator
  this.emulator = new MoiraEmulator(16 * 1024 * 1024);
  await this.emulator.initialize();

  // 2. Load ROM
  await this.loadROM();

  // 3. Boot ROM (let ROM initialize everything)
  await this.bootROM();

  // 4. Load door
  await this.loadDoor();

  // 5. Run!
  this.runExecutionLoop();
}
```

**That's it!** ROM handles all the complexity.

---

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. ROM Loading (Lines 129-145)

```typescript
private async loadROM(): Promise<void> {
  // Check ROM file exists
  if (!fs.existsSync(this.ROM_PATH)) {
    throw new Error(`Kickstart ROM not found at: ${this.ROM_PATH}`);
  }

  // Read and load ROM
  const romData = fs.readFileSync(this.ROM_PATH);
  this.emulator.loadROM(romData);
}
```

**Simple!** Just load the file and let loadROM() handle memory mapping.

### 2. ROM Boot Sequence (Lines 151-215)

```typescript
private async bootROM(): Promise<void> {
  // Reset CPU (reads SP/PC from exception vectors)
  this.emulator.reset();

  // Execute ROM until ExecBase is initialized
  const maxCycles = 50000000;  // 50M cycle safety limit
  let cycles = 0;

  while (cycles < maxCycles) {
    this.emulator.execute(10000);
    cycles += 10000;

    // Check every 100k cycles for ExecBase
    if (cycles % 100000 === 0) {
      const execBasePtr = this.emulator.readMemory32(0x000004);

      // Validate ExecBase structure
      if (execBasePtr >= 0x010000 && execBasePtr < 0x800000) {
        const version = this.emulator.readMemory16(execBasePtr + 0x14);
        const revision = this.emulator.readMemory16(execBasePtr + 0x16);

        if (version >= 30 && version <= 47) {
          // Valid Kickstart! Boot complete!
          this.execBaseAddr = execBasePtr;
          this.romBooted = true;
          console.log(`ROM BOOT COMPLETE! Kickstart ${version}.${revision}`);
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  throw new Error('ROM boot timeout');
}
```

**Strategy:**
- Execute ROM code in chunks
- Check periodically for ExecBase at 0x000004
- Validate version/revision to ensure it's real
- Return when system is initialized

**Safety:**
- 50M cycle timeout prevents infinite loops
- Progress logging every 10M cycles
- Validation prevents false positives

### 3. Door Loading (Lines 220-266)

```typescript
private async loadDoor(): Promise<void> {
  // Parse HUNK format
  const binary = fs.readFileSync(this.config.executablePath);
  const hunkFile = hunkLoader.parse(Buffer.from(binary));

  // Load segments into memory
  hunkLoader.load(this.emulator, hunkFile);

  // Set up CPU registers
  this.emulator.setRegister(15, initialSP);  // A7 (SP)
  this.emulator.setRegister(16, hunkFile.entryPoint);  // PC

  // Push exit sentinel
  const exitSentinel = 0xDEADBEEF;
  this.emulator.writeMemory32(initialSP - 4, exitSentinel);
  this.emulator.setRegister(15, initialSP - 4);

  // Set A6 for XIM-DOOR compatibility
  this.emulator.setRegister(14, this.execBaseAddr);  // A6
}
```

**Changes from before:**
- No manual system structure initialization
- No trap handler setup
- No RTS instruction writing
- Just load the binary and set registers

**ROM provides:**
- ExecBase ✓
- Library structures ✓
- Exception handlers ✓
- System initialization ✓

### 4. Execution Loop (Lines 271-311)

```typescript
private async runExecutionLoop(): Promise<void> {
  const CYCLES_PER_ITERATION = 10000;
  const exitSentinel = 0xDEADBEEF;

  while (this.isRunning) {
    // Execute cycles
    this.emulator.execute(CYCLES_PER_ITERATION);
    this.totalCycles += CYCLES_PER_ITERATION;

    // Check for exit
    const pc = this.emulator.getRegister(16);
    if (pc === exitSentinel) {
      console.log('Door completed - RTS to exit sentinel');
      this.terminate();
      return;
    }

    // Yield to event loop
    if (this.iterationCount % 100 === 0) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setImmediate(resolve));
    }
  }
}
```

**Simplified:**
- No trap handling
- No infinite loop detection
- No PC tracking
- Just execute and check for exit

## Files Modified

### Completely Rewritten:
- `AmigaDoorSession.ts` - 337 lines (was 450+)

### New Approach:
```
Old: 450+ lines of complex trap setup
New: 337 lines of simple ROM boot
Reduction: 113 lines removed (25% smaller)
Complexity: Dramatically reduced
```

### Files NOT Modified (Intentionally):
- `AmigaDosEnvironment.ts` - Old trap code, kept for test files
- `SystemStructures.ts` - Old trap code, kept for test files
- `AmiExpressLibrary.ts` - Old trap code, kept for test files
- `DosLibrary.ts` - Old trap code, kept for test files
- `ExecLibrary.ts` - Old trap code, kept for test files

**Why keep old files?**
- Test files still use them
- Not breaking anything
- Can be removed later if needed

## Architecture Comparison

### Old Trap-Based Architecture:

```
User Request
     ↓
AmigaDoorSession.start()
     ↓
Initialize Emulator (1MB memory)
     ↓
Load KickstartRom Class
     ↓
Manually Map ROM to Memory
     ↓
Initialize SystemStructures Class
     → Create ExecBase structure
     → Set up library pointers
     → Write exception handlers
     ↓
Create AmigaDosEnvironment Class
     → AmiExpressLibrary
     → DosLibrary
     → ExecLibrary
     ↓
Set up Trap Handlers
     → JavaScript callbacks
     → Virtual RTS instructions
     ↓
Write RTS to entire trap region (0xFF0000-0xFFFFFF)
     ↓
Load Door Binary
     ↓
Manual CPU Register Setup
     → Set ExecBase at address 4
     → Set SP
     → Set PC
     → Push exit sentinel
     → XIM-DOOR: Set A6
     ↓
Run Execution Loop
     → Execute cycles
     → Trap mechanism intercepts library calls
     → BUT: RTS executes before handler runs
     → Library functions never actually execute
     ↓
Door Fails ❌
```

**Problem:** Trap mechanism fundamentally broken. RTS executes immediately, library logic never runs.

### New ROM Boot Architecture:

```
User Request
     ↓
AmigaDoorSession.start()
     ↓
Initialize Emulator (16MB memory)
     ↓
Load Kickstart ROM
     → ROM mapped to 0xF80000-0xFFFFFF
     → Exception vectors copied to 0x000000
     ↓
Reset CPU
     → CPU reads SP from 0x000000
     → CPU reads PC from 0x000004
     → PC now points into ROM
     ↓
Execute ROM Code
     → ROM initializes system structures
     → ROM creates ExecBase
     → ROM opens libraries
     → ROM sets up exception handlers
     → ROM creates task structures
     ↓
Detect ExecBase Initialized
     → Check 0x000004 for valid pointer
     → Validate version/revision
     ↓
ROM Boot Complete ✓
     ↓
Load Door Binary
     → Set PC to door entry point
     → Set SP
     → Push exit sentinel
     ↓
Run Execution Loop
     → Door executes naturally
     → Door calls ROM library functions
     → ROM code executes (real 68k instructions)
     → Library functions actually run!
     → Results returned to door
     ↓
Door Works! ✓
```

**Result:** ROM code executes naturally. Library functions are real 68k code that runs properly.

---

## What Happens When Door Runs

### Old Trap Approach (Broken):

```
Door: JSR -54(A6)  ; Call aePutCh()
     ↓
CPU: Calculate address: A6 + (-54) = 0xFF0000 - 54 = 0xFEFFCA
     ↓
CPU: JSR 0xFEFFCA  ; Jump to library function
     ↓
moira-wrapper read16(0xFEFFCA):
     → Intercept! This is trap region!
     → Call JavaScript trapHandler(offset -54)
     → Return 0x4E75 (RTS instruction)
     ↓
CPU: Executes RTS instruction IMMEDIATELY
     → Returns to door
     ↓
JavaScript trapHandler runs NOW:
     → But CPU already returned!
     → Handler output goes nowhere!
     → Function logic never executed!
     ↓
Door: Expects result, got nothing ❌
Door: Crashes or loops forever ❌
```

### New ROM Approach (Works):

```
Door: JSR -54(A6)  ; Call aePutCh()
     ↓
CPU: A6 contains library base (from ExecBase library list)
CPU: Calculate address: A6 + (-54) = library function address
     ↓
CPU: JSR <function address>  ; Jump to ROM
     ↓
ROM: Actual 68k library function code executes
     → Function does its work
     → Updates system structures
     → Produces output
     → Calculates results
     ↓
ROM: RTS  ; Return from function
     ↓
Door: Receives correct results ✓
Door: Continues executing ✓
Door: Works properly! ✓
```

## Testing Plan

### Step 1: Verify ROM File Exists

```bash
ls -lh /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web/web/backend/data/roms/kick40068.A1200.rom
```

**Expected:** 512KB Kickstart 3.1 ROM file

### Step 2: Start Backend

```bash
cd /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web
./dev/scripts/start-backend.sh
```

### Step 3: Test GetAnswer Door

From BBS terminal:
```
DOORS
Select GetAnswer door
```

**Expected Behavior:**

**Scenario A: ROM Boots Successfully ✓**
```
[AmigaDoorSession] Loading Kickstart ROM...
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM file size: 524288 bytes
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM loaded successfully
[AmigaDoorSession] Booting ROM...
[AmigaDoorSession] CPU reset complete:
  SP: 0x00000500
  PC: 0x00f80278
[AmigaDoorSession] Executing ROM initialization...
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 10.0M cycles, PC=0xf82450
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 20.0M cycles, PC=0xf85abc
[AmigaDoorSession] *** ROM BOOT COMPLETE! ***
  ExecBase: 0x00010000
  Kickstart: 40.68
  Cycles: 25,432,100
  Time: 1250ms
  Speed: 20.35 MHz
[AmigaDoorSession] Loading door executable...
[AmigaDoorSession] Door ready to execute!
[AmigaDoorSession] Starting door execution...
```

**Then:** Door either:
1. **Works!** - Output appears in terminal ✓
2. **Crashes** - Need to implement AEDoor.library I/O interception

**Scenario B: ROM Boot Timeout ❌**
```
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 10.0M cycles, PC=0xf80278
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 20.0M cycles, PC=0xf80278
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 30.0M cycles, PC=0xf80278
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 40.0M cycles, PC=0xf80278
[AmigaDoorSession] ROM boot progress: 50.0M cycles, PC=0xf80278
Error: ROM boot timeout - ExecBase not initialized after 50M cycles
```

**Debugging:** PC stuck at same address = ROM hit infinite loop or waiting for hardware

**Scenario C: ROM Boot Crashes ❌**
```
[AmigaDoorSession] Executing ROM initialization...
Error: CPU exception / Invalid instruction / etc.
```

**Debugging:** ROM accessed hardware register we didn't stub, or hit unimplemented instruction

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### If ROM Boots Successfully:

**Option A: Door Works Immediately! 🎉**
- Door calls ROM functions naturally
- ROM aePutCh() produces output somehow
- We're done!

**Option B: Door Runs But No Output**
- ROM booted ✓
- Door executing ✓
- But aePutCh() output goes nowhere
- **Need:** Intercept AEDoor.library I/O calls
- **Solution:** Patch AEDoor.library function table with TRAP handlers

### If ROM Boot Fails:

**Debug Strategy:**
1. Log every memory access during first 1M cycles
2. Identify which hardware register ROM is stuck on
3. Add stub for that register
4. Repeat until ROM boots

**Common Issues:**
- ROM waiting for VBLANK interrupt (CIA timer)
- ROM waiting for keyboard acknowledge
- ROM accessing missing hardware register

**Fallback:**
- Limit ROM boot to just ExecBase initialization
- Don't let ROM go into Workbench startup
- May need to patch ROM to skip hardware checks
