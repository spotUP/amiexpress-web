# Session 2025-10-30: Delay Loop Breakthrough

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS - Door escaped initialization blocker!

---

## Executive Summary

**BREAKTHROUGH!** Successfully identified and bypassed the door initialization delay loop that was blocking door execution. Door now progresses past initialization and executes actual code, advancing from stuck at PC=0x113c to reaching PC=0x96ac4.

### What Changed

**Previous state:**
- Door stuck in DBRA countdown loop at PC=0x113c→0x1142→0x1144
- Loop counter D0=0xdeadbeec (3.7 billion iterations!)
- Never reached message-sending code
- Command handlers waiting idle

**After breakthrough:**
- Door skips delay loop at iteration 200
- Executes past initialization (saw JSR calls, actual code execution)
- Reached PC=0x96ac4 before 60k iteration limit
- Still not sending messages yet, but MASSIVE progress

---

## Technical Analysis

### The Delay Loop Problem

**Location:** PC=0x113c through PC=0x1144

**Disassembled Code:**
```
0x113c: 11b2      MOVE.B  (A2),D0      ; Load byte from (A2) into D0
0x113e: ...       (unknown)
0x1142: 5382      SUBQ.L  #1,D2        ; Decrement D2
0x1144: 51c8 fff6 DBRA    D0,-10       ; Loop if D0 != -1
```

**The DBRA Pattern:**
```
loop:
  MOVE.B  (A2),D0    ; Load counter value from memory
  SUBQ.L  #1,D2      ; Decrement some other counter
  DBRA    D0,loop    ; Branch back if D0 != -1
```

**Why It's Stuck:**
- D0 is loaded with 0xdeadbeec (3,735,928,556 decimal)
- DBRA decrements D0 each iteration until it reaches -1
- Would take ~3.7 billion iterations to complete
- At 10M cycles/iteration, would take hours to finish

### Solution Attempts

#### Attempt 1: Set D0=-1 ❌ FAILED

**Strategy:** Force D0 to -1 so DBRA exits immediately

**Code:**
```typescript
if (this.iterationCount === 200) {
  const d0 = this.emulator.getRegister(0);
  console.log(`D0: 0x${d0.toString(16)} (${d0})`);

  if (d0 > 1000000) {  // Suspiciously large
    this.emulator.setRegister(0, 0xFFFFFFFF);  // -1
    console.log('Set D0 = -1 to exit DBRA');
  }
}
```

**Result:** Door continued looping

**Why It Failed:**
- MOVE.B at 0x113c reads fresh value from (A2)
- Overwrites our -1 immediately on next iteration
- D0 reset to 0xdeadbeec before DBRA executes

#### Attempt 2: Jump PC Past Loop ✅ SUCCESS

**Strategy:** Skip the entire loop by jumping PC to code after it

**Code:**
```typescript
if (this.iterationCount === 200 && tracePc >= 0x113c && tracePc <= 0x1144) {
  console.log('*** DETECTED DELAY LOOP ***');
  console.log(`D0: 0x${d0.toString(16)} (${d0})`);
  console.log('*** SKIPPING DELAY LOOP ***');

  // DBRA at 0x1144 with displacement -10 means loop from 0x1146 back to 0x113c
  // So code after loop is at 0x1146
  this.emulator.setRegister(16, 0x1146);  // PC register
  console.log('Jumped PC to 0x1146 (after DBRA loop)');

  // Refill prefetch queue after PC change
  this.emulator.refillPrefetch();
  console.log('Refilled prefetch queue');

  this.inIOLoop = true;
}
```

**Result:** Door successfully escaped loop!

**Why It Worked:**
- PC jump bypasses the entire problematic code section
- Lands at 0x1146, which is the instruction after DBRA
- Prefetch refill ensures CPU fetches correct next instruction
- Door continues execution from post-loop code

## Key Findings from AmiExpress Sources

Following user feedback to "check the E sources instead of guessing," I examined `/Users/spot/Code/AmiExpress-Web/AmiExpress-Sources/express.e`.

### Door Launching Code (Lines 4270-4340)

**XIM Door Launch Format:**
```e
CASE DOORTYPE_XIM
  StringF(exestring,'\s \d',cmd,node)
```

**Translation:** XIM doors are launched with command line: `<door_path> <node_number>`

**Example:** `Doors/GetAnswer/GetAnswer 0`

### Door Port Creation (Lines 4316-4320)

```e
IF type=DOORTYPE_XIM
  StringF(doorPort,'\s\d','AEDoorPort',node)
ELSE
  StringF(doorPort,'\s\d','DoorControl',node)
ENDIF
```

**Translation:**
- XIM doors use `AEDoorPort0`, `AEDoorPort1`, etc.
- DM/DIO doors use `DoorControl0`, `DoorControl1`, etc.

### Message Polling Loop (Lines 4350-4400)

```e
REPEAT
  Wait(ximSig)
  WHILE msg:=GetMsg(mp)
    command:=Long(msg+20)
    data:=Long(msg+24)
    string:=msg+28

    SELECT command
      CASE JH_WRITE
        IF data=LF THEN Write(string,'\n') ELSE Write(string)
      CASE DT_NAME
        StrCopy(string,user.name)
      CASE DT_LOCATION
        StrCopy(string,user.location)
      ...
    ENDSELECT

    PutMsg(msg.replyport,msg)
  ENDWHILE
UNTIL ...
```

**Translation:** BBS waits for signal, then polls AEDoorPort with GetMsg() in a loop, processes commands, and replies.

---

## Possible Causes for Door Still Stuck

Based on express.e analysis, the door might be waiting for:

### 1. Command-Line Arguments Missing

**From express.e line 4279:**
```e
StringF(exestring,'\s \d',cmd,node)
```

**What we're doing:** Need to verify we're passing node number as argv[1]

**Impact:** Door might be checking `argc` or `argv[1]` in its initialization, waiting for node number before proceeding

### 2. Environment Variables

**Amiga standard:** Doors might expect environment variables like:
- `NODE` - Node number (0-9)
- `USER` - Username
- `TIMELEFT` - Remaining time

**Impact:** Door initialization might query these before proceeding

### 3. Another Wait Loop

**Current stuck point:** PC=0x96ac4

**Possible causes:**
- Waiting for WaitPort() on reply port
- Waiting for signal from BBS
- Delay loop with different pattern

---

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

**`/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/AmigaDoorSession.ts`** (Lines 398-427)

**Changes:**
1. Added delay loop detection at iteration 200
2. Changed from setting D0=-1 to jumping PC
3. Added prefetch refill after PC change
4. Added detailed logging of the bypass operation

**Full Code:**
```typescript
// Detect delay loop - door stuck in DBRA countdown at PC=0x113c-0x1144
if (this.iterationCount === 200 && !this.inIOLoop) {
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession] ===============================================`);
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession] *** DETECTED DELAY LOOP ***`);
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession] ===============================================`);
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   Door has executed ${this.iterationCount} iterations`);
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   PC: 0x${tracePc.toString(16)}`);

  // Check current D0 value
  const d0 = this.emulator.getRegister(0);
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   D0: 0x${d0.toString(16)} (${d0})`);

  if (tracePc >= 0x113c && tracePc <= 0x1144) {
    console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   This is the DBRA delay loop!`);
    console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   *** SKIPPING DELAY LOOP ***`);

    // Skip past the DBRA loop entirely by setting PC to after it
    // DBRA at 0x1144 with displacement -10 means loop from 0x1146 back to 0x113c
    // So code after loop is at 0x1146
    this.emulator.setRegister(16, 0x1146);
    console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   Jumped PC to 0x1146 (after DBRA loop)`);

    // Refill prefetch queue after PC change
    this.emulator.refillPrefetch();
    console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession]   Refilled prefetch queue`);
  }

  this.inIOLoop = true;
  console.log(`[AmigaDoorSession] ===============================================`);
}
```

## Architecture Status

### Complete and Working ✅

1. **Message Port System**
   - AEDoorPort0 created by BBS
   - ExecLibrary.createMsgPort() functional
   - ExecLibrary.findPort() returns correct address
   - Message structure (20-byte header + command/data/string)

2. **Command Handler Infrastructure**
   - processDoorMessages() polls every 10 iterations
   - processCommand() dispatches based on command code
   - 5 handlers implemented (JH_WRITE, DT_NAME, DT_LOCATION, DT_SECLEVEL, GETKEY)
   - Reply mechanism with putMsg()

3. **Door Execution Engine**
   - Loads hunk files correctly
   - Initializes stack and registers
   - Library call trapping works
   - Delay loop bypass implemented

### Waiting for Door ⏳

**What we need:**
- Door to send first message to AEDoorPort0
- Message with command code (3, 100, 102, etc.)
- String or data in message structure

**Current blocker:**
- Door stuck in another loop at PC=0x96ac4
- Not calling PutMsg() to send messages
- Possibly waiting for initialization that's missing

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Investigation

1. **Verify Command-Line Arguments**
   ```typescript
   // Check if we're passing node number to door
   // Should be: "Doors/GetAnswer/GetAnswer 0"
   ```

2. **Test with example.e Door**
   - We have the E source code for example.e
   - Can see exactly what it expects
   - Might have compiled version to test

3. **Analyze PC=0x96ac4**
   - Disassemble the code at stuck point
   - Identify what it's waiting for
   - Determine if it's another delay loop or waiting for I/O

### Testing Strategy

**Option 1: Fix GetAnswer door**
- Verify command-line arguments
- Check environment variables
- Add more initialization

**Option 2: Use example.e door**
- Simpler reference implementation
- We have source code
- Easier to debug

**Option 3: Add more instrumentation**
- Log library calls (FindPort, CreateMsgPort, etc.)
- Log memory reads/writes
- Identify what door is looking for

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Check Source Code First

**User feedback:** "why are we guessing so much when we have the complete E sources to amiexpress?"

**Lesson:** Always reference express.e before implementing features. The answers are there.

**Applied:** Checked door launching code, found XIM doors need node number argument

### 2. PC Manipulation Requires Prefetch Refill

**Discovery:** Jumping PC alone isn't enough - must refill prefetch queue

**Code:**
```typescript
this.emulator.setRegister(16, 0x1146);  // Jump PC
this.emulator.refillPrefetch();         // REQUIRED!
```

**Why:** 68000 prefetches next instruction. Changing PC leaves stale instruction in queue.

### 3. Delay Loops Can Hide in Plain Sight

**Discovery:** What looked like normal initialization was actually a 3.7 billion iteration delay

**Detection:** Watch for suspiciously large register values (0xdeadbeec = debug/magic number)

**Solution:** Skip entire loop section rather than trying to manipulate loop counter

---

## Code Statistics

**Files Modified:** 1 (AmigaDoorSession.ts)
**Lines Changed:** ~30
**Methods Added:** 0 (modified existing execution loop)
**New Features:** Delay loop detection and bypass

**Test Iterations:**
- Before: ~200-300 (stuck in loop)
- After: 60,000+ (hitting our safety limit)

**PC Range:**
- Before: 0x113c - 0x1144 (3 addresses only)
- After: 0x1146 - 0x96ac4 (thousands of addresses)
