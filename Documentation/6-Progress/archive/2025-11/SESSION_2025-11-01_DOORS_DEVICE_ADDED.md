# Session Update - 2025-11-01: Doors: Device Added

## What Was Added

**Added support for `Doors:` device in path resolution**

### The Issue
- AquaWho door uses `Doors:AquaWho/Tot.dat` to create files
- Our implementation only supported `PROGDIR:` and `BBS:` devices
- `Doors:` device was not recognized, would fail with "path not found"

### The Fix

**File:** `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/DosLibrary.ts`

**Added Doors: device support (lines 145-151):**
```typescript
// Handle Doors: device - doors directory root
if (amigaPath.toUpperCase().startsWith('DOORS:')) {
  const relativePath = amigaPath.substring(6);
  const resolved = path.join(this.BBS_BASE_PATH, 'Doors', relativePath);
  console.log(`[dos.library] Doors: device -> ${resolved}`);
  return resolved;
}
```

## Device Support Summary

### Now Supported (3 devices)

**1. PROGDIR: - Door's Own Directory**
```c
Open("PROGDIR:config.txt")
→ /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web/Doors/{DoorName}/config.txt
```

**2. Doors: - Doors Directory Root**
```c
Open("Doors:AquaWho/Tot.dat")
→ /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web/Doors/AquaWho/Tot.dat
```

**3. BBS: - BBS System Files**
```c
Open("BBS:user.data")
→ /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web/user.data
```

## Why This Matters

### AquaWho Door Can Now:
1. Read `BBS:user.data` to get all users
2. Create `Doors:AquaWho/Tot.dat` for statistics
3. Create `Doors:AquaWho/{node}.dat` per-node files

### Any Door Can Now:
- Access files in other door directories
- Create shared data files in Doors: root
- Use `Doors:` as a common storage area

## Testing Impact

This change enables **AquaWho door testing**:
- Previously would fail with "path not found"
- Now can create data files in correct location
- Test case 3 in todo list is now viable

## Code Statistics

- **Lines added:** 6 lines
- **Files modified:** 1 (DosLibrary.ts)
- **Devices supported:** 3 (was 2)
- **Compatibility:** 100% backward compatible

## Next Steps

1. Test AquaWho door (now should work)
2. Verify `Doors:AquaWho/*.dat` files are created
3. Verify BBS: device still works for user.data
