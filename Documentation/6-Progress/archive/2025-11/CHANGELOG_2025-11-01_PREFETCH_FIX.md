## Root Cause Analysis

### The Prefetch Queue Bug

**Problem**: After returning from library traps, the M68K instruction prefetch queue (IRD/IRC) was not synchronized with the new PC, causing the emulator to execute stale instructions.

**Symptoms**:
- PC advanced by 4 bytes for 2-byte instructions
- Door crashed at iteration 209 with PC=0xF00080 (unmapped memory)
- Initially appeared to be memory corruption or instruction length bug

**Root Cause**:
```
M68K Prefetch Queue:
  IRD = Current instruction being executed
  IRC = Next instruction word (to be executed after IRD)

After trap return:
  1. Trap handler sets PC to return address ✓
  2. Prefetch queue NOT updated ✗
  3. Moira executes STALE instruction from old IRD
  4. PC advances incorrectly → crash
```

## Files Modified

### 1. moira-wrapper.cpp

**Location**: `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/cpu/moira-wrapper.cpp`
**Lines**: 560-576

**Change**: Fixed `refillPrefetch()` to properly load IRD and IRC

**Before** (BROKEN):
```cpp
void refillPrefetch() {
    u16 opcode = read16(this->reg.pc);
    setIRC(opcode);  // ❌ Both set to same value!
    setIRD(opcode);
}
```

**After** (FIXED):
```cpp
void refillPrefetch() {
    // IRD = instruction at PC (will be executed next)
    u16 ird_val = read16(this->reg.pc);
    setIRD(ird_val);

    // IRC = instruction at PC+2 (will be executed after IRD)
    u16 irc_val = read16(this->reg.pc + 2);
    setIRC(irc_val);

    EM_ASM({
        console.log('[MOIRA] Prefetch queue refilled at PC=0x' + $0.toString(16));
        console.log('  IRD (current) = 0x' + $1.toString(16).padStart(4, '0'));
        console.log('  IRC (next) = 0x' + $2.toString(16).padStart(4, '0'));
    }, this->reg.pc, ird_val, irc_val);
}
```

**Impact**: Correctly emulates M68K prefetch behavior, fixing PC advancement bug.

---

### 2. LibraryTraps.ts

**Location**: `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/LibraryTraps.ts`
**Lines**: 790-794

**Change**: Enabled `refillPrefetch()` call after library trap returns

**Before**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: DO NOT call refillPrefetch() here!
// this.emulator.refillPrefetch();  // REMOVED - causes register corruption
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Refill instruction prefetch queue!
// After setting PC, we MUST refill the prefetch queue to synchronize
// queue.ird and queue.irc with the new PC location.
// The fixed refillPrefetch() now properly sets IRD and IRC without executing.
this.emulator.refillPrefetch();
```

**Impact**: Synchronizes prefetch queue after every trap return, ensuring correct execution.

---

### 3. ExecLibrary.ts - AllocSignal()

**Location**: `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/ExecLibrary.ts`
**Lines**: 101-102 (tracking), 588-638 (implementation)

**Change**: Added signal allocation tracking and AllocSignal() method

**Added**:
```typescript
// Signal allocation tracking (32 signals, bits 0-31)
private allocatedSignals: number = 0; // Bitmask of allocated signals

/**
 * AllocSignal() - LVO -330 (0xFFFFFEB6)
 *
 * Allocate a signal bit for inter-process communication.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   D0 = Signal number to allocate (-1 = any free signal)
 *
 * Returns:
 *   D0 = Signal number (0-31) or -1 if none available
 */
AllocSignal(signalNum: number): number {
    // Implementation handles both specific signal requests and "any free" (-1)
    // Uses bitmask to track allocated signals (0-31)
    // Returns signal number or -1 on failure
}
```

**Test Result**:
```
[ExecLibrary] AllocSignal(255)
  Allocated signal 0, mask=0x1
```

**Impact**: Door can now allocate signals for IPC and synchronization.

---

### 4. ExecLibrary.ts - AddPort()

**Location**: `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/api/ExecLibrary.ts`
**Lines**: 681-726

**Change**: Added AddPort() method to make ports publicly findable

**Added**:
```typescript
/**
 * AddPort() - LVO -354 (0xFFFFFE9E)
 *
 * Add a message port to the public list.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   A1 = MsgPort pointer
 *
 * Returns:
 *   None
 *
 * Makes a port publicly findable via FindPort().
 */
addPort(portAddr: number): void {
    // Reads port name from port structure (offset +10)
    // Adds to publicPorts registry
    // Marks port as NT_MSGPORT (type 4)
}
```

**Test Result**:
```
[ExecLibrary] AddPort(0x1c82) - adding public port "DoorReplyPort"
[ExecLibrary]   Port "DoorReplyPort" is now public
```

**Impact**: Door can register its reply port, enabling message communication.

---

### 5. AmigaDoorSession.ts - Port Name Fix

**Location**: `/web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/AmigaDoorSession.ts`
**Lines**: 202-210

**Change**: Fixed port name from "AEDoorPort0" to "AEDoorPort"

**Before**:
```typescript
const nodeId = this.config.bbsSession?.nodeId || 0;
const portName = `AEDoorPort${nodeId}`;  // "AEDoorPort0"
```

**After**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Door searches for "AEDoorPort" (without node number)
// The original AmiExpress uses a single shared port name for all nodes
const portName = 'AEDoorPort';
```

**Test Result**:
```
[ExecLibrary] FindPort("AEDoorPort")
[ExecLibrary]   Found "AEDoorPort" at 0xa0000  ✅
[ExecLibrary] PutMsg(port=0xa0000, msg=0x1ca4)  ✅
[AmigaDoorSession] *** DOOR MESSAGE RECEIVED (via PutMsg trap) ***  ✅
```

**Impact**: Door successfully finds AEDoorPort and sends messages to BBS!

## Technical Details

### M68K Prefetch Queue Behavior

The Motorola 68000 uses a 2-stage pipeline:

```
Pipeline Stage 1: IRD (Instruction Register - Decode)
  - Contains opcode currently being executed
  - Read from memory at PC during previous instruction

Pipeline Stage 2: IRC (Instruction Register - Cache)
  - Contains next instruction word
  - Read from memory at PC+2
  - Will become IRD after current instruction completes

Program Counter (PC):
  - Points to the NEXT instruction to prefetch (PC+4)
  - Advanced by 2 at start of execute()
```

### Why Manual PC Changes Need Prefetch Refill

When PC is manually set (library trap return, exception, jump):
1. PC now points to new code location
2. But IRD/IRC still contain OLD instructions from before PC change
3. Next execute() will run the WRONG instruction (stale IRD)
4. PC advances incorrectly
5. Chaos ensues!

**Solution**: After ANY manual PC change, refill both IRD and IRC from the new PC location.

## Known Issues (Future Work)

### Current Door Crash

**Location**: PC=0x80000 at iteration 99,627
**Likely Cause**: Door finished initialization, waiting for BBS response
**Next Steps**:
- Implement Wait() for signal waiting
- Implement Signal() for task signaling
- Process door messages and send replies
- Implement XIM protocol message handling

### Stack Misalignment Warnings

The door generates stack misalignment warnings near the end. This may be:
- Expected behavior for certain door operations
- Edge case in emulation
- Requires investigation in future session

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Processor-Level Details Matter

Small details in CPU architecture (like prefetch queues) can cause catastrophic failures. Must understand the hardware deeply.

### 2. Question All Assumptions

The comment "DO NOT call refillPrefetch()" was based on a broken implementation. Always verify assumptions and check the actual code.

### 3. Systematic Debugging Works

Added logging at each level:
- Memory contents ✓
- PC tracking ✓
- Register state ✓
- Instruction decoding ✓
- **Prefetch queue** ← The missing piece!

### 4. False Leads Are Normal

Investigated memory corruption, hunk loading, relocations, instruction bugs. All were wrong, but elimination was necessary to find the real issue.

### 5. Port Names Matter!

A simple name mismatch ("AEDoorPort0" vs "AEDoorPort") blocked communication. Always check against the original source behavior.

---

## Next Session Goals

1. **Investigate PC=0x80000 crash** - Understand why door reaches this address
2. **Implement Wait()/Signal()** - Enable door to wait for BBS responses
3. **Process XIM messages** - Parse and respond to door messages
4. **Test full door interaction** - Complete request/response cycle
5. **Verify terminal I/O** - Ensure door can send output to user

## Deployment Notes

### Files to Rebuild

1. **WASM Module** - Already rebuilt with fixed refillPrefetch()
   - Location: `web/backend/src/amiga-emulation/cpu/build/moira.wasm`
   - Rebuilt successfully during session

2. **Backend TypeScript** - Changes to AmigaDoorSession.ts and ExecLibrary.ts
   - Will auto-reload with tsx if using dev scripts

### Testing

Run the door test:
```bash
cd /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web
node test-getanswer-door.js
```

Expected result:
- Door reaches 90,000+ iterations
- Messages sent to BBS successfully
- "✓ SUCCESS: All library trap messages detected!"
