# Session 2025-11-01: XIM Protocol Fix & Message Passing

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Duration**: Full session
**Status**: ✅ MAJOR SUCCESS - Door communication working!

---

## 🎉 Major Achievements

### 1. Fixed XIM Protocol Message Structure (jhMessage)

**Problem**: Door messages appeared as "Unknown commands" (17408, 18277, 44975)

**Root Cause**: Incorrect message structure parsing. We were reading command at offset 20, but the actual `jhMessage` structure (from axcommon.e lines 543-557) is:

```
OBJECT jhMessage
  <Message header>     // 20 bytes (offsets 0-19)
  string[200]          // 200 bytes (offsets 20-219) ← STRING COMES FIRST!
  data: LONG           // 4 bytes (offsets 220-223)
  command: LONG        // 4 bytes (offsets 224-227)
ENDOBJECT
```

**Solution**:
- Read command from offset **224** (not 20)
- Read data from offset **220** (not 22)
- Read embedded string from offsets **20-219** (200 bytes)

**Files Changed**:
- `XIMProtocol.ts:parseMessage()` - Fixed to read correct offsets
- `XIMProtocol.ts:handleSendMessage()` - Use embedded string instead of pointer
- `XIMProtocol.ts:XIMMessage` interface - Added `string?` field

**Result**: ✅ Door now sends valid XIM commands (JH_REGISTER, JH_SM)

---

### 2. Fixed Message Port Registration (AddPort)

**Problem**: Door called `AddPort(0x1c82)` to register "DoorReplyPort", but `PutMsg(0x1c82)` couldn't find it!

**Root Cause**: `AddPort()` was only adding ports to `this.publicPorts` registry (for FindPort lookup), but `PutMsg()` and `GetMsg()` check `this.messagePorts` registry!

**Solution**: AddPort() now registers ports in BOTH registries:
```typescript
// For FindPort lookup
this.publicPorts.set(name, portAddr);

// For PutMsg/GetMsg/WaitPort
this.messagePorts.set(portAddr, port);
```

**File Changed**: `ExecLibrary.ts:addPort()` lines 719-740

**Result**: ✅ GetMsg() now successfully returns messages to door!

---

### 3. Implemented BSS Segment Loading

**Problem**: Door tried to access memory at 0x7005c which wasn't allocated

**Root Cause**: Hunk loader was only allocating the size of data IN FILE, not the full segment size from header. The header includes BSS (uninitialized data), but HUNK_DATA only contains initialized data.

**Solution**:
- Read `totalSegmentSize` from header (includes BSS)
- Read `hunkDataSize` from HUNK_DATA (file data only)
- Allocate full `totalSegmentSize`
- Copy `hunkDataSize` bytes from file
- Zero-fill remaining BSS portion

**File Changed**: `HunkLoader.ts` lines 112-151

**Example**:
- Header says segment 1 = 856 bytes (214 longwords)
- HUNK_DATA says 596 bytes to read
- BSS = 856 - 596 = **260 bytes** (zero-filled)

**Result**: ✅ Door's static data structures now properly allocated

### 4. Door Successfully Displays Messages! 🎉

**THE BIG WIN**: Door output now appears in terminal!

```
GetAnswer v1.2 by Agamemnon / Moment 22
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
```

This is the **FIRST time a compiled 68000 Amiga door has successfully communicated with the BBS!**

---

### 5. Complete Message Passing Cycle Working

**Full door communication flow now functional**:

1. ✅ Door sends `PutMsg(AEDoorPort, message)` with JH_REGISTER
2. ✅ BBS receives message via trap handler
3. ✅ XIM protocol parses command from offset 224
4. ✅ BBS processes JH_REGISTER command
5. ✅ BBS calls `ReplyMsg(message)`
6. ✅ ReplyMsg sends to door's reply port (0x1c82) via PutMsg
7. ✅ PutMsg finds port in registry (now works!)
8. ✅ PutMsg calls Signal() to wake waiting task
9. ✅ Door calls `GetMsg(replyPort)`
10. ✅ GetMsg returns message (now works!)
11. ✅ Door processes reply and sends next message

**Result**: ✅ **Full bidirectional message passing working!**

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes

1. **XIMProtocol.ts**
   - `parseMessage()`: Fixed offsets (224, 220, 20-219)
   - `handleSendMessage()`: Use embedded string
   - `XIMMessage` interface: Added `string?` field

2. **ExecLibrary.ts**
   - `addPort()`: Register in both `publicPorts` and `messagePorts`
   - `waitPort()`: Auto-register unknown ports from memory

3. **HunkLoader.ts**
   - HUNK_CODE/DATA handler: Use header size, zero-fill BSS
   - Calculate `bssSize = totalSegmentSize - hunkDataSize`

### Minor Fixes

4. **conference.handler.ts**
   - Fixed SQLite Date binding (convert to ISO string)

## Test Results

### Before Today's Session
- Door crashed at iteration 209 with PC jump to unmapped memory
- No door-BBS communication
- XIM commands showed as "Unknown"

### After Today's Session
- ✅ Door reaches **99,627 iterations** (476x improvement!)
- ✅ Door sends 3 XIM messages (JH_REGISTER + 2×JH_SM)
- ✅ BBS receives and processes all messages
- ✅ BBS sends replies back to door
- ✅ Door receives all replies via GetMsg()
- ✅ **Door output displays in terminal!**

### Test Command
```bash
cd /Users/spot/Code/amiexpress-web
node test-getanswer-door.js
```

**Expected output**:
```
GetAnswer v1.2 by Agamemnon / Moment 22
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### The jhMessage Structure Discovery

The breakthrough came from reading `axcommon.e` (express.e:543-557):

```e
EXPORT OBJECT jhMessage
  <mn_Node + mn_ReplyPort + mn_Length>  // 20 bytes
  string[200]: ARRAY OF CHAR            // 200 bytes ← CRITICAL!
  data: LONG                            // 4 bytes
  command: LONG                         // 4 bytes
ENDOBJECT
```

**Key insight**: Unlike typical C structures where pointers come first, the E language EMBEDS the 200-byte string array BEFORE the data/command fields!

This is why we were reading garbage at offset 20 - we were reading the STRING contents as if they were the command!

### The Two Registry Problem

ExecLibrary had two separate port registries:
- `publicPorts: Map<string, number>` - Name → Address (for FindPort)
- `messagePorts: Map<number, MessagePort>` - Address → Port object (for PutMsg/GetMsg)

AddPort() only updated `publicPorts`, so:
- ✅ FindPort("DoorReplyPort") worked
- ❌ PutMsg(0x1c82, msg) failed - port not found!

Solution: AddPort() now updates BOTH registries.

### BSS Allocation Algorithm

```typescript
const totalSegmentSize = header.segmentSizes[i] * 4;  // From header
const hunkDataSize = this.readLong() * 4;              // From HUNK
const bssSize = totalSegmentSize - hunkDataSize;       // Implicit BSS

const fullData = new Uint8Array(totalSegmentSize);    // Allocate full size
fullData.set(data, 0);                                 // Copy file data
// Rest is zero-filled automatically by Uint8Array constructor
```

## Current Status

### What's Working ✅

- M68K emulation with prefetch queue synchronization
- Library trap interception (JSR to library vectors)
- exec.library functions:
  - OpenLibrary, CloseLibrary
  - FindPort, AddPort
  - CreateMsgPort (for AEDoorPort)
  - PutMsg, GetMsg, ReplyMsg, WaitPort
  - AllocSignal, Signal, Wait
  - AllocMem
- XIM protocol message parsing (JH_REGISTER, JH_SM, etc.)
- Full door-to-BBS message passing
- Door output display in terminal

### Known Issue ⚠️

**Door crashes at PC=0x80000 after 99,627 iterations**

**Analysis**:
- Door successfully sends all 3 startup messages
- Door receives all replies from BBS
- After final message, door stops making library calls
- Door executes through BSS memory (0x2FFC → 0x80000)
- PC hits 0x80000, triggers exception → jumps to 0xF00080 (unmapped)

**Likely cause**: Door completes its task but doesn't properly exit. Instead of calling Exit() or returning cleanly, it continues executing into uninitialized memory.

**Not a blocker**: The door HAS successfully communicated with the BBS. The crash happens AFTER successful communication.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Iterations | 209 | 99,627 | **+99,418** |
| Improvement | 1x | **476x** | +47,500% |

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Investigate PC=0x80000 crash**
   - Check if door needs Exit() implementation
   - Verify if door expects to be terminated by BBS
   - May not be critical - door has already done its job

2. **Implement remaining XIM commands**
   - JH_LI (Line Input)
   - JH_HK (Hotkey)
   - JH_WRITE (Write to terminal)
   - Data query commands (DT_NAME, DT_PASSWORD, etc.)

3. **Test with interactive door**
   - Current test door (GetAnswer) only sends messages
   - Try a door that expects user input
   - Verify line input and hotkey handling

4. **Test with other doors**
   - AquaWho (user list door)
   - T-Join (Tempest door)
   - Verify compatibility across different door types

## Conclusion

**This session achieved a HISTORIC milestone**: We now have working door-to-BBS communication with a real compiled 68000 Amiga door program displaying output in the terminal!

The fixes were surgical and based on reading the actual source code (axcommon.e) rather than guessing. The jhMessage structure discovery was the key breakthrough that unlocked proper XIM protocol parsing.

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for you to test and enjoy seeing door output in the BBS!** 🎉
