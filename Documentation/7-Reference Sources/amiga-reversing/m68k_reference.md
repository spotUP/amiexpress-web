- **Size**: Size = (Byte, Word, Long)
- **Page**: 125

Arithmetically shifts the bits of the operand in the direction (L or R) specified. The carry bit receives the last bit shifted out of the operand. The shift count for the shifting of a register may be specified in two different ways: 1. Immediate—The shift count is specified in the instruction (shift range, 1 – 8). 2. Register—The shift count is the value in the data register specified in instruction modulo 64. The size of the operation can be specified as byte, word, or long. An operand in mem- ory can be shifted one bit only, and the operand size is restricted to a word. For ASL, the operand is shifted left; the number of positions shifted is the shift count. Bits shifted out of the high-order bit go to both the carry and the extend bits; zeros are shifted into the low-order bit. The overflow bit indicates if any sign changes occur dur- ing the shift. . C OPERAND O ASL: X MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 4-21 Integer Instructions ASL, ASR ASL, ASR Arithmetic Shift (M68000 Family) For ASR, the operand is shifted right; the number of positions shifted is the shift count.

- **Processors**: M68000 Family
- **Operation**: `If Condition True`
- **Syntax**: `Bcc < label >`
- **Size**: Size = (Byte, Word, Long*)
- **Page**: 129

If the specified condition is true, program execution continues at location (PC) + displacement. The program counter contains the address of the instruction word for the Bcc instruction plus two. The displacement is a twos-complement integer that represents the relative distance in bytes from the current program counter to the destination program counter. If the 8-bit displacement field in the instruction word is zero, a 16-bit displacement (the word immediately following the instruction) is used. If the 8-bit displacement field in the instruction word is all ones ($FF), the 32-bit displacement (long word immediately following the instruction) is used. Condition code cc specifies one of the following conditional tests (refer to Table 3-19 for more information on these conditional tests): Mnemonic Condition Mnemonic Condition CC(HI) Carry Clear LS Low or Same CS(LO) Carry Set LT Less Than EQ Equal MI Minus GE Greater or Equal NE Not Equal GT Greater Than PL Plus HI High VC Overflow Clear LE Less or Equal VS Overflow Set

## BKPT
**Breakpoint**

- **Operation**: `Run Breakpoint Acknowledge Cycle; TRAP As Illegal Instruction`
- **Syntax**: `BKPT # < data >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 157

For the MC68010, a breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle is run with function codes driven high and zeros on all address lines. Whether the breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle is terminated with DTACK, BERR, or VPA, the processor always takes an illegal instruction exception. During exception processing, a debug monitor can distinguish different software breakpoints by decoding the field in the BKPT instruction. For the MC68000 and MC68008, the breakpoint cycle is not run, but an illegal instruction exception is taken. For the MC68020, MC68030, and CPU32, a breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle is exe- cuted with the immediate data (value 0 – 7) on bits 2 – 4 of the address bus and zeros on bits 0 and 1 of the address bus. The breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle accesses the CPU space, addressing type 0, and provides the breakpoint number specified by the instruction on address lines A2 – A4. If the external hardware terminates the cycle with DSACKx or STERM, the data on the bus (an instruction word) is inserted into the instruction pipe and is executed after the breakpoint instruction. The breakpoint instruc- tion requires a word to be transferred so, if the first bus cycle accesses an 8- bit port, a second bus cycle is required. If the external logic terminates the breakpoint acknowl- edge bus cycle with BERR (i.e., no instruction word available), the processor takes an illegal instruction exception. For the MC68040, this instruction executes a breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle. Regardless of the cycle termination, the MC68040 takes an illegal instruction excep- tion. For more information on the breakpoint instruction refer to the appropriate user’s man- ual on bus operation. This instruction supports breakpoints for debug monitors and real- time hardware emu- lators.

## CAS CAS2
**Compare and Swap with Operand**

- **Processors**: MC68020, MC68030, MC68040
- **Operation**: `CAS Destination – Compare Operand → cc;`
- **Syntax**: `CAS2 Dc1:Dc2,Du1:Du2,(Rn1):(Rn2)`, `*`
- **Size**: Size = (Byte , Word, Long)
- **Page**: 170

CAS compares the effective address operand to the compare operand (Dc). If the operands are equal, the instruction writes the update operand (Du) to the effective address operand; otherwise, the instruction writes the effective address operand to the compare operand (Dc). CAS2 compares memory operand 1 (Rn1) to compare operand 1 (Dc1). If the oper- ands are equal, the instruction compares memory operand 2 (Rn2) to compare oper- and 2 (Dc2). If these operands are also equal, the instruction writes the update operands (Du1 and Du2) to the memory operands (Rn1 and Rn2). If either comparison fails, the instruction writes the memory operands (Rn1 and Rn2) to the compare oper- ands (Dc1 and Dc2). Both operations access memory using locked or read-modify-write transfer sequences, providing a means of synchronizing several processors.

Compares the value in Rn to each bound. The effective address contains the bounds pair: the upper bound following the lower bound. For signed comparisons, the arithmetically smaller value should be used as the lower bound. For unsigned comparisons, the logically smaller value should be the lower bound. The size of the data and the bounds can be specified as byte, word, or long. If Rn is a data register and the operation size is byte or word, only the appropriate low-order part of Rn is checked. If Rn is an address register and the operation size is byte or word, the bounds operands are sign-extended to 32 bits, and the resultant operands are compared to the full 32 bits of An. If the upper bound equals the lower bound, the valid range is a single value. If the reg- ister value is less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, a CHK instruc- tion exception (vector number 6) occurs.

Controls a loop of instructions. The parameters are a condition code, a data register (counter), and a displacement value. The instruction first tests the condition for termination; if it is true, no operation is performed. If the termination condition is not true, the low-order 16 bits of the counter data register decrement by one. If the result is – 1, execution continues with the next instruction. If the result is not equal to – 1, execution continues at the location indicated by the current value of the program counter plus the sign-extended 16-bit displacement. The value in the program counter is the address of the instruction word of the DBcc instruction plus two. The displacement is a twos complement integer that represents the relative distance in bytes from the current program counter to the destination program counter. Condition code cc specifies one of the following conditional tests (refer to Table 3-19 for more information on these conditional tests): Mnemonic Condition Mnemonic Condition CC(HI) Carry Clear LS Low or Same CS(LO) Carry Set LT Less Than EQ Equal MI Minus F False NE Not Equal GE Greater or Equal PL Plus GT Greater Than T True HI High VC Overflow Clear LE Less or Equal VS Overflow Set

Divides the signed destination operand by the signed source operand and stores the signed result in the destination. The instruction uses one of four forms. The word form of the instruction divides a long word by a word. The result is a quotient in the lower word (least significant 16 bits) and a remainder in the upper word (most significant 16 bits). The sign of the remainder is the same as the sign of the dividend. The first long form divides a long word by a long word. The result is a long quotient; the remainder is discarded. The second long form divides a quad word (in any two data registers) by a long word. The result is a long-word quotient and a long-word remainder. The third long form divides a long word by a long word. The result is a long-word quo- tient and a long-word remainder. Two special conditions may arise during the operation: 1. Division by zero causes a trap. 2. Overflow may be detected and set before the instruction completes. If the in- struction detects an overflow, it sets the overflow condition code, and the oper- ands are unaffected.

**Condition Codes:**

- **Size**: Size = (Line)
- **Page**: 230

Moves the source line to the destination line. The lines are aligned to 16-byte boundaries. Applications for this instruction include coprocessor communications, memory initialization, and fast block copy operations. MOVE16 has two formats. The postincrement format uses the postincrement address- ing mode for both source and destination; whereas, the absolute format specifies an absolute long address for either the source or destination. Line transfers are performed using burst reads and writes, which begin with the long word pointed to by the effective address of the source and destination, respectively. An address register used in the postincrement addressing mode is incremented by 16 after the transfer. Example: MOVE16 (A0) + $FE802 A0 = $1400F The line at address $14000 is read into a temporary holding register by a burst read transfer starting with long-word $14000. Address values in A0 of $14000 – $1400F cause the same line to be read, starting at different long words. The line is then written to the line at address $FE800 beginning with long-word $FE800 after the instruction A0 contains $1401F. Source line at $14000: $14000 $14004 $14008 $1400C LONG WORD 0 LONG WORD 1 LONG WORD 2 LONG WORD 3 Destination line at $FE8000: $FE800 $FE804 $FE808 $FE80C LONG WORD 0 LONG WORD 1 LONG WORD 2 LONG WORD 3 4-126 M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL MOTOROLA Integer Instructions MOVE16 MOVE16 Move 16-Byte Block (MC68040)

Moves the contents of selected registers to or from consecutive memory locations starting at the location specified by the effective address. A register is selected if the bit in the mask field corresponding to that register is set. The instruction size determines whether 16 or 32 bits of each register are transferred. In the case of a word transfer to either address or data registers, each word is sign-extended to 32 bits, and the resulting long word is loaded into the associated register. Selecting the addressing mode also selects the mode of operation of the MOVEM instruction, and only the control modes, the predecrement mode, and the postincre- ment mode are valid. If the effective address is specified by one of the control modes, the registers are transferred starting at the specified address, and the address is incre- mented by the operand length (2 or 4) following each transfer. The order of the regis- ters is from D0 to D7, then from A0 to A7. If the effective address is specified by the predecrement mode, only a register-to-mem- ory operation is allowed. The registers are stored starting at the specified address minus the operand length (2 or 4), and the address is decremented by the operand length following each transfer. The order of storing is from A7 to A0, then from D7 to D0. When the instruction has completed, the decremented address register contains the address of the last operand stored. For the MC68020, MC68030, MC68040, and CPU32, if the addressing register is also moved to memory, the value written is the ini- tial register value decremented by the size of the operation. The MC68000 and MC68010 write the initial register value (not decremented). If the effective address is specified by the postincrement mode, only a memory-to-reg- ister operation is allowed. The registers are loaded starting at the specified address; the address is incremented by the operand length (2 or 4) following each transfer. The order of loading is the same as that of control mode addressing. When the instruction has completed, the incremented address register contains the address of the last oper- and loaded plus the operand length. If the addressing register is also loaded from memory, the memory value is ignored and the register is written with the postincre- mented effective address. 4-128 M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL MOTOROLA Integer Instructions MOVEM MOVEM Move Multiple Registers (M68000 Family)

Moves data between a data register and alternate bytes within the address space starting at the location specified and incrementing by two. The high-order byte of the data register is transferred first, and the low-order byte is transferred last. The memory address is specified in the address register indirect plus 16-bit displacement addressing mode. This instruction was originally designed for interfacing 8-bit peripherals on a 16-bit data bus, such as the MC68000 bus. Although supported by the MC68020, MC68030, and MC68040, this instruction is not useful for those processors with an external 32-bit bus. Example: Long transfer to/from an even address.

Pushes and then invalidates selected cache lines. The DATA cache, instruction cache, both caches, or neither cache can be specified. When the data cache is specified, the selected data cache lines are first pushed to memory (if they contain dirty DATA) and then invalidated. Selected instruction cache lines are invalidated. Specific cache lines can be selected in three ways: 1. CPUSHL pushes and invalidates the cache line (if any) matching the physical address in the specified address register. 2. CPUSHP pushes and invalidates the cache lines (if any) matching the physical memory page in the specified address register. For example, if 4K-byte page sizes are selected and An contains $12345000, all cache lines matching page $12345000 are selected. 3. CPUSHA pushes and invalidates all cache entries.

## FRESTORE
**Restore Internal**

- **Processors**: MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only
- **Operation**: `If in Supervisor State`
- **Syntax**: `FRESTORE < ea >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 465

Aborts the execution of any floating-point operation in progress and loads a new floating-point unit internal state from the state frame located at the effective address. The first word at the specified address is the format word of the state frame. It specifies the size of the frame and the revision number of the floating-point unit that created it. A format word is invalid if it does not recognize the size of the frame or the revision number does not match the revision of the floating-point unit. If the format word is invalid, FRESTORE aborts, and a format exception is generated. If the format word is valid, the appropriate state frame is loaded, starting at the specified location and proceeding through higher addresses. The FRESTORE instruction does not normally affect the programmer’s model registers of the floating-point coprocessor, except for the NULL state size, as described below. It is only for restoring the user invisible portion of the machine. The FRESTORE instruction is used with the FMOVEM instruction to perform a full context restoration of the floating-point unit, including the floating- point data registers and system control registers. To accomplish a complete restoration, the FMOVEM instructions are first executed to load the programmer’s model, followed by the FRESTORE instruction to load the internal state and continue any previously suspended operation. MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-11 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions FRESTORE FRESTORE Restore Internal Floating-Point State (MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only) The current implementation supports the following four state frames: NULL: This state frame is 4 bytes long, with a format word of $0000. An FRE- STORE operation with this size state frame is equivalent to a hardware reset of the floating-point unit. The programmer’s model is set to the reset state, with nonsignaling NANs in the floating-point data registers and zeros in the floating-point control register, floating-point status register, and floating- point instruction address register. (Thus, it is unnecessary to load the pro- grammer’s model before this operation.) IDLE: This state frame is 4 bytes long in the MC68040, 28 ($1C) bytes long in the MC68881, and 60 ($3C) bytes long in the MC68882. An FRESTORE oper- ation with this state frame causes the floating-point unit to be restored to the idle state, waiting for the initiation of the next instruction, with no exceptions pending. The programmer’s model is not affected by loading this type of state frame. UNIMP: This state frame is generated only by the MC68040. It is 48 ($30) bytes long. An FSAVE that generates this size frame indicates either an unimplemented floating-point instruction or only an E1 exception is pending. This frame is never generated when an unsupported data type exception is pending or an E3 exception is pending. If both E1 and E3 exceptions are pending, a BUSY frame is generated. BUSY: This state frame is 96 ($60) bytes long in the MC68040, 184 ($B8) bytes long in the MC68881, and 216 ($D8) bytes long in the MC68882. An FRESTORE operation with this size state frame causes the floating-point unit to be restored to the busy state, executing the instructions that were suspended by a previous FSAVE operation. The programmer’s model is not affected by loading this type of state frame; however, the completion of the suspended instructions after the restore is executed may modify the programmer’s model. Floating-Point Status Register: Cleared if the state size is NULL; otherwise, not affected. 6-12 M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL MOTOROLA Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions FRESTORE FRESTORE Restore Internal Floating-Point State (MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only)

## FSAVE
**Save Internal Floating-Point State**

- **Processors**: MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only
- **Operation**: `If in Supervisor State`
- **Syntax**: `FSAVE < ea >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 468

FSAVE allows the completion of any floating-point operation in progress for the MC68040. It saves the internal state of the floating-point unit in a state frame located at the effective address. After the save operation, the floating-point unit is in the idle state, waiting for the execution of the next instruction. The first word written to the state frame is the format word specifying the size of the frame and the revision number of the floating-point unit. Any floating-point operations in progress when an FSAVE instruction is encountered can be completed before the FSAVE executes, saving an IDLE state frame. Execution of instructions already in the floating-point unit pipeline continues until completion of all instructions in the pipeline or generation of an exception by one of the instructions. An IDLE state frame is created by the FSAVE if no exceptions occurred; otherwise, a BUSY or an UNIMP stack frame is created. FSAVE suspends the execution of any operation in progress and saves the internal state in a state frame located at the effective address for the MC68881/MC68882. After the save operation, the floating-point coprocessor is in the idle state, waiting for the execution of the next instruction. The first word written to the state frame is the format word, specifying the size of the frame and the revision number of the floating-point coprocessor. The microprocessor unit initiates the FSAVE instruction by reading the floating-point coprocessor save CIR. The floating-point coprocessor save CIR is encoded with a format word that indicates the appropriate action to be taken by the main processor. The current implementation of the floating-point coprocessor always returns one of five responses in the save CIR: Value Definition $0018 Save NULL state frame $0118 Not ready, come again Illegal, take format exception $0218 $XX18 Save IDLE state frame $XXB4 Save BUSY state frame NOTE: XX is the floating-point coprocessor version number. 6-14 M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL MOTOROLA Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions FSAVE FSAVE Save Internal Floating-Point State (MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only) The not ready format word indicates that the floating-point coprocessor is not prepared to perform a state save and that the microprocessor unit should process interrupts, if necessary, and re-read the save CIR. The floating-point coprocessor uses this format word to cause the main processor to wait while an internal operation completes, if pos- sible, to allow an IDLE frame rather than a BUSY frame to be saved. The illegal format word aborts an FSAVE instruction that is attempted while the floating-point coproces- sor executes a previous FSAVE instruction. All other format words cause the micropro- cessor unit to save the indicated state frame at the specified address. For state frame details see state frames in the appropriate user’s manual. The following state frames apply to both the MC68040 and the MC68881/MC68882. NULL: This state frame is 4 bytes long. An FSAVE instruction that generates this state frame indicates that the floating-point unit state has not been modified since the last hardware reset or FRESTORE instruction with a NULL state frame. This indicates that the programmer’s model is in the reset state, with nonsignaling NANs in the floating-point data registers and zeros in the float- ing- point control register, floating-point status register, and floating-point instruction address register. (Thus, it is not necessary to save the program- mer’s model.) IDLE: This state frame is 4 bytes long in the MC68040, 28 ($1C) bytes long in the MC68881, and 60 ($3C) bytes long in the MC68882. An FSAVE instruction that generates this state frame indicates that the floating-point unit finished in an idle condition and is without any pending exceptions waiting for the ini- tiation of the next instruction. UNIMP: This state frame is generated only by the MC68040. It is 48 ($30) bytes long. An FSAVE that generates this size frame indicates either an unimplemented floating-point instruction or that only an E1 exception is pending. This frame is never generated when an unsupported data type exception or an E3 exception is pending. If both E1 and E3 exceptions are pending, a BUSY frame is generated. BUSY: This state frame is 96 ($60) bytes long in the MC68040, 184 ($B8) bytes long in the MC68881, and 216 ($D8) bytes long in the MC68882. An FSAVE instruction that generates this size state frame indicates that the floating- point unit encountered an exception while attempting to complete the execu- tion of the previous floating-point instructions. MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-15 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions FSAVE FSAVE Save Internal Floating-Point State (MC68881, MC68882, MC68040 only) The FSAVE does not save the programmer’s model registers of the floating-point unit; it saves only the user invisible portion of the machine. The FSAVE instruction may be used with the FMOVEM instruction to perform a full context save of the floating-point unit that includes the floating-point data registers and system control registers. To accomplish a complete context save, first execute an FSAVE instruction to suspend the current operation and save the internal state, then execute the appropriate FMOVEM instructions to store the programmer’s model. Floating-Point Status Register: Not affected.

This instruction is a looping primitive of three parameters: an MC68851 condition, a counter (an MC68020 data register), and a 16-bit displacement. The instruction first tests the condition to determine if the termination condition for the loop has been met. If so, the main processor executes the next instruction in the instruction stream. If the termination condition is not true, the low-order 16 bits of the counter register are decremented by one. If the result is not D1, execution continues at the location specified by the current value of the program counter plus the sign-extended 16-bit displacement. The value of the program counter used in the branch address calculation is the address of the PDBcc instruction plus two.

## PFLUSH

- **Operation**: `If Supervisor State`
- **Syntax**: `PFLUSH FC,MASK`, `PFLUSH FC,MASK, < ea >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 486

PFLUSH invalidates address translation cache entries. The instruction has three forms. The PFLUSHA instruction invalidates all entries. When the instruction specifies a function code and mask, the instruction invalidates all entries for a selected function code(s). When the instruction also specifies an < ea > , the instruction invalidates the page descriptor for that effective address entry in each selected function code. The mask operand contains three bits that correspond to the three function code bits. Each bit in the mask that is set to one indicates that the corresponding bit of the FC operand applies to the operation. Each bit in the mask that is zero indicates a bit of FC and of the ignored function code. For example, a mask operand of 100 causes the instruction to consider only the most significant bit of the FC operand. If the FC operand is 001, function codes 000, 001, 010, and 011 are selected. The FC operand is specified in one of the following ways: 1. Immediate—Three bits in the command word. 2. Data Register—The three least significant bits of the data register specified in the instruction. 3. Source Function Code (SFC) Register 4. Destination Function Code (DFC) Register

- **Size**: Unsigned
- **Page**: 492

PFLUSHA invalidates all entries in the address translation cache. PFLUSH invalidates a set of address translation cache entries whose function code bits satisfy the relation: (address translation cache function code bits and mask) = (FC and MASK) for all entries whose task alias matches the task alias currently active when the instruction is executed. With an additional effective address argument, PFLUSH invalidates a set of address translation cache entries whose function code satisfies the relation above and whose effective address field matches the corresponding bits of the evaluated effective address argument. In both of these cases, address translation cache entries whose SG bit is set will not be invalidated unless the PFLUSHS is spec- ified. The function code for this operation may be specified as follows: 1. Immediate—The function code is four bits in the command word. 2. Data Register—The function code is in the lower four bits of the MC68020 data register specified in the instruction. 3. Source Function Code (SFC) Register—The function code is in the CPU SFC register. Since the SFC of the MC68020 has only three implemented bits, only function codes $0D$7 can be specified in this manner. 4. Destination Function Code (DFC) Register—The function code is in the CPU DFC register. Since the DFC of the MC68020 has only three implemented bits, only function codes $0D$7 can be specified in this manner. 6-38 M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL MOTOROLA Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions PFLUSH PFLUSH PFLUSHA PFLUSHA PFLUSHS PFLUSHS Invalidate Entries in the ATC (MC68851) PMMU Status Register: Not affected.

## PFLUSHR
**Invalidate ATC and RPT Entries**

- **Processors**: MC68851
- **Operation**: `If Supervisor State`
- **Syntax**: `PFLUSHR < ea >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 495

The quad word pointed to by < ea > is regarded as a previously used value of the CPU root pointer register. The root pointer table entry matching this CPU root pointer register (if any) is flushed, and all address translation cache entries loaded with this value of CPU root pointer register (except for those that are globally shared) are invalidated. If no entry in the root pointer table matches the operand of this instruction, no action is taken. If the supervisor root pointer is not in use, the operating system should not issue the PFLUSHR command to destroy a task identified by the current CPU root pointer reg- ister. It should wait until the CPU root pointer register has been loaded with the root pointer identifying the next task until using the PFLUSHR instruction. At any time, exe- cution of the PFLUSHR instruction for the current CPU root pointer register causes the current task alias to be corrupted.

## PLOAD
**Load an Entry into the ATC**

For the MC68851, PLOAD searches the translation table for a translation of the specified effective address. If one is found, it is flushed from the address translation cache, and an entry is made as if a bus master had run a bus cycle. Used and modified bits in the table are updated as part of the table search. The MC68851 ignores the logical bus arbitration signals during the flush and load phases at the end of this instruction. This prevents the possibility of an entry temporarily disappearing from the address translation cache and causing a false table search. This instruction will cause a paged memory management unit illegal operation excep- tion (vector $39) if the E-bit of the translation control register is clear. The function code for this operation may be specified to be: 1. Immediate—The function code is specified as four bits in the command word. 2. Data Register—The function code is contained in the lower four bits in the MC68020 data register specified in the instruction. 3. Source Function Code (SFC) Register—The function code is in the CPU SFC register. Since the SFC of the MC68020 has only three implemented bits, only function codes $0D$7 can be specified in this manner. 4. Destination Function Code (DFC) Register—The function code is in the CPU DFC register. Since the DFC of the MC68020 has only three implemented bits, only function codes $0D$7 can be specified in this manner. MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-43 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions PLOAD PLOAD Load an Entry into the ATC (MC68030 only, MC68851) For the MC68030, PLOAD searches the address translation cache for the specified effective address. It also searches the translation table for the descriptor corresponding to the specified effective address. It creates a new entry as if the MC68030 had attempted to access that address. Sets the used and modified bits appropriately as part of the search. The instruction executes despite the value of the E-bit in the translation control register or the state of the MMUDIS signal. The < function code > operand is specified in one of the following ways: 1. Immediate—Three bits in the command word. 2. Data Register—The three least significant bits of the data register specified in the instruction. 3. Source Function Code (SFC) Register 4. Destination Function Code (DFC) Register The effective address field specifies the logical address whose translation is to be loaded. PLOADR causes U bits in the translation tables to be updated as if a read access had occurred. PLOADW causes U and M bits in the translation tables to be updated as if a write access had occurred. PMMU Status Register: Not affected.

## PMOVE
**Move to/from MMU Registers**

Moves the contents of the source effective address to the specified memory management unit register or moves the contents of the memory management unit register to the destination effective address. The instruction is a quad-word (8 byte) operation for the CPU root pointer and the supervisor root pointer. It is a long-word operation for the translation control register and the transparent translation registers (TT0 and TT1). It is a word operation for the MMU status register. The PMOVEFD form of this instruction sets the FD-bit to disable flushing the address translation cache when a new value loads into the supervisor root pointer, CPU root pointer, TT0, TT1 or translation control register (but not the MMU status register). Writing to the following registers has the indicated side effects: CPU Root Pointer—When the FD-bit is zero, it flushes the address translation cache. If the operand value is invalid for a root pointer descriptor, the instruction takes an memory management unit configuration error exception after moving the operand to the CPU root pointer. Supervisor Root Pointer—When the FD-bit is zero, it flushes the address translation cache. If the operand value is invalid as a root pointer descriptor, the instruction takes an memory management unit configuration error exception after moving the operand to the supervisor root pointer. Translation Control Register—When the FD-bit is zero, it flushes the address transla- tion cache. If the E-bit = 1, consistency checks are performed on the PS and TIx fields. If the checks fail, the instruction takes an memory management unit configuration exception after moving the operand to the translation control register. If the checks pass, the translation control register is loaded with the operand and the E-bit is cleared. TT0, TT1—When the FD-bit is zero, it flushes the address translation cache. It enables or disables the transparent translation register according to the E-bit written. If the E- bit = 1, the transparent translation register is enabled. If the E- bit = 0, the register is disabled. MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-47 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions PMOVE PMOVE Move to/from MMU Registers (MC68030 only)

## PRESTORE
**PMMU Restore Function**

- **Processors**: MC68851
- **Operation**: `If Supervisor State`
- **Syntax**: `PRESTORE < ea >`
- **Size**: Unsized, Privileged
- **Page**: 511

The MC68851 aborts execution of any operation in progress. New programmer registers and internal states are loaded from the state frame located at the effective address. The first word at the specified address is the format word of the state frame, specifying the size of the frame and the revision number of the MC68851 that created it. The MC68020 writes the first word to the MC68851 restore coprocessor interface register, initiating the restore operation. Then it reads the response coprocessor interface register to verify that the MC68851 recognizes the format as valid. The format is invalid if the MC68851 does not recognize the frame size or the revision number does not match. If the format is invalid, the MC68020 takes a format exception, and the MC68851 returns to the idle state with its user visible registers unchanged. However, if the format is valid, then the appropriate state frame loads, starting at the specified location and proceeding up through the higher addresses. The PRESTORE instruction restores the nonuser visible state of the MC68851 as well as the PMMU status register, CPU root pointer, supervisor root pointer, current access level, valid access level, and stack change control registers of the user programming model. In addition, if any breakpoints are enabled, all breakpoint acknowledge control and breakpoint acknowledge data registers are restored. This instruction is the inverse of the PSAVE instruction. The current implementation of the MC68851 supports four state frame sizes: NULL: This state frame is 4 bytes long, with a format word of $0. A PRESTORE with this size state frame places the MC68851 in the idle state with no coproces- sor or module operations in progress. IDLE: This state frame is 36 ($24) bytes long. A PRESTORE with this size state frame causes the MC68851 to place itself in an idle state with no coproces- sor operations in progress and no breakpoints enabled. A module operation may or may not be in progress. This state frame restores the minimal set of MC68851 registers. MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-57 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions PRESTORE PRESTORE PMMU Restore Function (MC68851) MID-COPROCESSOR: This state frame is 44 ($2C) bytes long. A PRESTORE with this size frame restores the MC68851 to a state with a coprocessor operation in progress and no breakpoints enabled. BREAKPOINTS ENABLED: This state frame is 76 ($4C) bytes long. A PRESTORE with this size state frame restores all breakpoint registers, along with other states. A coprocessor operation may or may not be in progress. PMMU Status Register: Set according to restored data.

The MC68851 suspends execution of any operation that it is performing and saves its internal state and some programmer registers in a state frame located at the effective address. The following registers are copied: PMMU status, control root pointer, supervisor root pointer, current access level, valid access level, and stack change control. If any breakpoint is enabled, all breakpoint acknowledge control and breakpoint acknowledge data registers are copied. After the save operation, the MC68851 is in an idle state waiting for another operation to be requested. Programmer registers are not changed. The state frame format saved by the MC68851 depends on its state at the time of the PSAVE operation. In the current implementation, three state frames are possible: IDLE: This state frame is 36 ($24) bytes long. A PSAVE of this size state frame indi- cates that the MC68851 was in an idle state with no coprocessor operations in progress and no breakpoints enabled. A module call operation may or may not have been in progress when this state frame was saved. MID-COPROCESSOR:This state frame is 44 ($2C) bytes long. A PSAVE of this size frame indicates that the MC68851 was in a state with a coprocessor or mod- ule call operation in progress and no breakpoints enabled. BREAKPOINTS ENABLED:This state frame is 76 ($4C) bytes long. A PSAVE of this size state frame indicates that one or more breakpoints were enabled. A coprocessor or module call operation may or may not have been in progress.

This instruction searches the address translation cache or the translation tables to a specified level. Searching for the translation descriptor corresponding to the < ea > field, it sets the bits of the MMU status register according to the status of the descriptor. Optionally, PTEST stores the physical address of the last table entry accessed during the search in the specified address register. The PTEST instruction searches the address translation cache or the translation tables to obtain status information, but alters neither the used or modified bits of the translation tables nor the address translation cache. When the level operand is zero, only the transparent translation of either read or write accesses causes the operations of the PTESTR and PTESTW to return different results. The < function code > operand is specified as one of the following: 1. Immediate—Three bits in the command word. 2. Data Register—The three least significant bits of the data register specified in the instruction. 3. Source Function Code (SFC) Register 4. Destination Function Code (DFC) Register The effective address is the address to test. The < level > operand specifies the level of the search. Level 0 specifies searching the addrass translation cache only. Levels 1–7 specify searching the translation tables only. The search ends at the specified level. A level 0 test does not return the same MMU status register values as a test at a nonzero level number. Execution of the instruction continues to the requested level or until detecting one of the following conditions: • Invalid Descriptor • Limit Violation • Bus Error Assertion (Physical Bus Error) MOTOROLA M68000 FAMILY PROGRAMMER’S REFERENCE MANUAL 6-63 Supervisor (Privileged) Instructions PTEST PTEST Test a Logical Address (MC68030 only) The instruction accumulates status as it accesses successive table entries. When the instruction specifies an address translation cache search with an address register operand, the MC68030 takes an F-line unimplemented instruction exception. If there is a parameter specification for a translation table search, the physical address of the last descriptor successfully fetched loads into the address register. A success- fully fetched descriptor occurs only if all portions of the descriptor can be read by the MC68030 without abnormal termination of the bus cycle. If the root pointer’s DT field indicates page descriptor, the returned address is $0. For a long descriptor, the address of the first long word is returned. The size of the descriptor (short or long) is not returned and must be determined from a knowledge of the translation table.

- **Syntax**: `STOP # < data >`
- **Size**: Unsized
- **Page**: 539

Moves the immediate operand into the status register (both user and supervisor portions), advances the program counter to point to the next instruction, and stops the fetching and executing of instructions. A trace, interrupt, or reset exception causes the processor to resume instruction execution. A trace exception occurs if instruction tracing is enabled (T0 = 1, T1 = 0) when the STOP instruction begins execution. If an interrupt request is asserted with a priority higher than the priority level set by the new status register value, an interrupt exception occurs; otherwise, the interrupt request is ignored. External reset always initiates reset exception processing.
