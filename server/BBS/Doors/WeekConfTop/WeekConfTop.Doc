                                 PRESENTS

                 -=> WeekConfTop V1.0 - ASM XIM DOOR <=-

    PROFESSIONAL TOOLS FOR PROFESSIONAL SYSOPS - GET THE REAL QUALITY !


WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS TOOL ?
-----------------------------

        This door displays a list of your week-top-uploaders !

        At the End of the Week it sends a message (configurable) !

        The Week Top-Uploader gets an extra bonus (configurable) !

        It is a XIM and NO CLI tool, this means you don't waste
        time in your logoff-batch for it !

        It is so fucking fast that the user doesn't see any
        difference from a file displayed from your HD !
        
        Enjoy the maximum (ASM) speed and perfection...

        If you use /X3.x+ you need CONFERENCE ACCOUNTING TURNED ON !
        (Simply because /X3.x+ does not store the creds in Conf.DB
         when turned OFF, LAME !)

        If you are a lucky user of S-Express V0.39m+ then there is
        no matter if Conference Accounting is ON or OFF, works in
        both cases (S-Express rules) !

        Enjoy !

HOW TO INSTALL :
----------------

        Copy the files in the archive to your directories,
        they are :

        BBS:Doors/WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Config
        BBS:Doors/WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.XIM
        BBS:Doors/WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Doc
        BBS:Doors/WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Header
        BBS:Doors/WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Tailer
        LIBS:AEDoor.library ( © Sintax/WOT )

        The WeekConfTop.Config looks like this :
 
        --------(cut here)--------
        1                                    <- Displaymode !
        N                                    <- Y/N turns first line on/off !
        10                                   <- Amount of Users to display !
        BBS:User.Data                        <- The Location of your User.Data !
        EALL                                 <- Where to send the message !
        10                                   <- % given as Bonus !
        DOORS:WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Header <- Headertext to be displayed !
        DOORS:WeekConfTop/WeekConfTop.Tailer <- Tailertext to be displayed !
        --------------------------

        The first line is the displaymode :

        1 - Show DL Bytes in second column !
        2 - Show UL Files and DL Files in second column !

        The first line (Y/N) is for a better look with the header
        in the archive. If you use your own header or NO header,
        then please use Y to give it a better look ! You'll see !

        The Tailer-Text can be left out.
        

        Now if you use /X2.x or S-Express then append the
        BBS:Commands/BBS.CMD to your BBS.CMD !

        If you use /X3.x copy the BBS:Commands/BBSCMD/Week.Info
        to your BBS:Commands/BBSCMD/ !
        
        Ok, now the door is installed and a user can call it with
        typing WEEK, but normally you want it displayed during
        logon sequence ! Use this in a file during logon :

        ~CC_WEEK

        This will call the door !

        The advantage is that you don't have to add another util
        to your logoffbatch !!!

        If you have a week-top tool running, then remove it
        from your logoffbatch and replace the files where it normally
        outputs to with the ones in the BBS:Screens dir in the archive !

        Now you're ready to enjoy !


 |||    Only for S-Express users :
 |||    If it shows weird things, just grab the latest S-Express
 |||    version from Synergy ! Should work perfectly on some
 |||    newer versions to come !


        Some hints for proper running :
        -------------------------------

        I suggest you start it on Monday, so you get the output
        on the first caller the next Monday... but you can choose
        which day you want ! To RESTART it delete the Conf.DB.TOP !
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since I currently do not know what's up with GOD, I release this stuff
under my name ! I always wanted to continue the group but it looks like
that most members can not call for free/are inactive  ! If there is any
active member left I would be lucky if you can contact me (see above) !

Let the scene go back to the good old days... have fun out there !
