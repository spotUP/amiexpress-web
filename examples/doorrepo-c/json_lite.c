/* json_lite.c - narrow, targeted JSON extraction. See json_lite.h for the
 * interface contract and the reasoning behind each decision.
 *
 * This door speaks plain HTTP by design (see README.md's "Security"
 * section) and the owner-mode curation plan's admin API responses parsed
 * here (login token, submissions list) arrive over that same untrusted
 * network path. README.md's vulnerability class #4 - "unbounded response
 * bodies" - was found and fixed once already elsewhere in this door (the
 * catalog fetch and archive download had no ceiling on total bytes
 * received); every function in this file is the same class of defense
 * applied to a new parser:
 *
 *   - Every scan is byte-by-byte over a NUL-terminated buffer, and every
 *     scan loop's termination condition checks for '\0' FIRST, before any
 *     other test - so a truncated/adversarial buffer with no closing
 *     quote/brace/escape sequence can never be read past its terminator.
 *   - Every scan loop ALSO carries a JSON_LITE_MAX_SCAN_BYTES cap,
 *     independent of the NUL check - defense in depth against a future
 *     caller that violates the "always NUL-terminated" contract, per this
 *     plan's own instruction not to rely entirely on the caller.
 *   - json_next_array_object()'s bracket-nesting stack is a small FIXED
 *     array (JSON_LITE_MAX_ARRAY_DEPTH), never dynamically sized -
 *     nesting deeper than that is refused, not overflowed.
 *   - No function here ever writes past the end of a caller-supplied
 *     buffer: every write is preceded by a capacity check against
 *     `outcap`/`outsize`, and every failure path leaves the output empty
 *     ("") rather than partially filled.
 *
 * C89. No stdint.h (not available on the m68k-amiga-elf/vbcc toolchain).
