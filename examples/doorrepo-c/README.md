# DoorRepo C Client

A reference AmiExpress door, written in strict C89, that lets a sysop browse,
search, and download door archives from the DoorRepo catalog
(`docs/DOOR-REPO-API.md`) directly from the BBS. It is meant to be read and
adapted: every module is small, unit-tested, and documented well enough that
a builder with no prior exposure to this repository can either run it as-is
or lift the parts they need (the `list.txt` parser, the streaming HTTP
client, the MD5 implementation, the AEDoorPort message-port glue) into their
own door.

The door does six things, in order, each in its own module:

- Loads `DoorRepo.cfg` (`config.c`) -- repo host/path, download directory,
  page size, timeouts, extraction settings. Every value has a safe default,
  so the door runs with no config file at all.
- Fetches and parses `list.txt` (`listtxt.c`) -- the catalog's pipe-delimited
  text format, streamed and parsed one line at a time, never buffered whole.
- Streams the HTTP request/response (`http.c` over `netio.c`) -- chunked
  reads with per-read timeouts, so a stalled peer cannot hang the door
  forever.
- Hashes downloads while they land on disk (`md5.c`) -- streaming MD5, no
  second pass over the file.
- Talks the real AmiExpress door-port protocol (`aedoor.h` /
  `aedoor_amiga.c` / `aedoor_native.c`) -- JHMessage-based I/O against the
  BBS, or plain stdio for development.
- Ties it together (`doorrepo.c` / `flow.c`) -- pagination, filtering,
  download-then-verify-then-optionally-extract, and the retry state machine
  for a digest mismatch. `flow.c` holds every piece of decision logic
  (pagination math, query-string construction, filename/shell-safety checks)
  as pure functions with no I/O, so it is unit-tested without a network, a
  filesystem, or an Amiga.

Credit: the door-port protocol implementation is derived from reading the
real AmiExpress door glue, `AEDoor.c`, and the official protocol reference,
`doordocs.txt` (both under
`/Users/spot/Code/amiexpress_doors/Sources/_C/AE_DOORS/` in the sysop's
source tree) -- not from this repository's TypeScript emulator. Every
JHMessage field offset and command code in `aedoor_amiga.c` cites the
doordocs.txt line it came from.

## Building

Two targets, both driven by the one `Makefile` in this directory.

### Native (development, testing, the `live` target)

```
make native
```

Produces `doorrepo`, a plain POSIX binary built with `cc -std=c89 -Wall
-Wextra -pedantic`. This is what `make test` and `make live` run. No special
setup required beyond a C compiler.

### AmigaOS m68k (the real target)

```
make amiga
```

Produces `doorrepo.amiga`, cross-compiled with vbcc (`vc +aos68k`) and linked
against the AmigaOS NDK. **This target builds the door's real networking
branch** -- the one that opens `bsdsocket.library` and talks to the repo
server over a live socket, not a stub.

The Amiga socket branch (`netio.c`'s `#elif defined(AMIGA)` section) needs
three things no plain AmigaOS SDK install provides on its own: `sys/socket.h`,
`netinet/in.h`, and `netdb.h`. **This repository vendors a complete copy of
NDK3.2R4 at `Documentation/7-Reference Sources/NDK3.2R4/`, and the Makefile
points at it by default -- you do not need to supply your own AmiTCP/Roadshow
SDK to build the real networking target.** If you have your own SDK and
prefer to use it instead, override it:

```
make amiga NETINCLUDE=/path/to/your/sdk/netinclude
```

`NETINCLUDE=` is an **override, not a requirement**. Leave it unset and
`make amiga` uses the vendored copy.

**Include-order constraint.** `<devices/timer.h>` is needed for
`WaitSelect()`'s `struct timeval` parameter, and two different copies of it
exist on a machine that also has the `m68k-amiga-elf-gcc` toolchain
installed: that toolchain's own copy wraps `tv_sec`/`tv_usec` in an anonymous
union (a GNU extension vbcc rejects with "warning 53: struct/union member
needs identifier"), while the vendored NDK3.2R4 copy is a plain, non-union
struct that compiles clean under vbcc. **The vendored `devices/timer.h` must
be found first in the include search path**, ahead of any other SDK's copy.
The Makefile handles this automatically (see its `AMIGA_NDK_SHIM` block) by
symlinking just that one header into a small shim directory placed first on
`-I`. If you rearrange the Makefile's `-I` flags -- for example, to point
`NETINCLUDE` at your own SDK -- keep the vendored `devices/timer.h` ahead of
any other toolchain's `devices/` directory, or the build will fail on that
warning.

### Other targets

```
make amiga-stub   # doorrepo.amiga-stub: real m68k cross-compile, but with
                   # a networking stub instead of bsdsocket.library. Needs
                   # no AmiTCP SDK at all. Proves every module OTHER than
                   # netio.c's real socket branch is m68k-clean.
make test          # builds and runs all six native unit-test suites
make live           # builds native and runs it once against the live API
make clean          # removes every build artifact
```

## Verification status

This table is deliberately specific about what was checked, how, and what
was not, because the gap between "compiles" and "works on a real machine"
is exactly where door authors get burned.

| Layer | Status | How it was checked |
|---|---|---|
| Every module's logic (parsing, pagination, retry state machine, security checks) | **Unit-tested and native-run verified** | `make test`: 6 suites, 406 assertions, 0 failures, `-std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic` clean. `make live` run against the real, live `bbs.uprough.net` API: browsed, paged forward/back, filtered by type, searched, opened an entry, downloaded a real archive, MD5 verified. Full transcript in this task's report. |
| POSIX/native build | **Built and run-verified** | `make native` links and runs on this machine; this is the build every test suite and the live run above actually exercises. |
| Every module except netio.c's real socket branch, cross-compiled for m68k | **Compile- and link-verified** | `make amiga-stub` produces a real `AmigaOS loadseg()ble executable/binary` (confirmed with `file`), zero warnings, with no AmiTCP SDK involved at all. |
| netio.c's real `bsdsocket.library` branch, cross-compiled for m68k | **Compile- AND link-verified for m68k** | `make amiga` produces a complete, real `AmigaOS loadseg()ble executable/binary` (confirmed with `file`) linked against the vendored NDK3.2R4, zero warnings. This is stronger than "compiles": the object code genuinely links into a loadable AmigaOS program, and every symbol `netio.c`'s Amiga branch calls (`OpenLibrary`, `socket`, `connect`, `WaitSelect`, `send`, `recv`, `CloseSocket`, ...) resolved. It is **not** merely "compile-only" -- do not read it that way. |
| The door-port (AEDoorPort/XIM) protocol AND `bsdsocket.library` networking, together, under this repository's own 68K emulator | **Run-verified end to end under emulation** | See "Emulator run" below. The real `doorrepo.amiga` binary, unmodified, ran inside this repo's own AEDoorPort/XIM emulator and its `bsdsocket.library` bridge: `PortStart`/`JH_REGISTER` succeeded, it fetched the real 3301-row catalog from the live API over an emulated socket, browsed, paged, filtered by type, searched, downloaded a real archive, and verified its MD5 -- all inside the emulator, all against the live production host, all confirmed independently outside the door's own claims. |
| Running against a **real** `bsdsocket.library` on real AmigaOS hardware (or an Amiga-accurate emulator such as vAmiga/WinUAE/FS-UAE) | **NOT run-verified** | No such environment exists in this development environment. This remains the one honest gap, and it is a materially different claim than "not run-verified at all": everything above proves the door's logic, protocol usage, and networking calls are correct and functional end to end against *an* AEDoorPort/`bsdsocket.library` implementation -- just not the real one. Running under this repository's emulator is evidence the door works; it is not the same claim as working on an Amiga. |

### What "not run-verified" means in practice

The emulator run below is real, end-to-end evidence: unmodified `doorrepo.amiga`
machine code executed on an emulated 68000 CPU, called `OpenLibrary()`,
`socket()`, `connect()`, `WaitSelect()`, `send()`, and `recv()` against this
repository's own `bsdsocket.library` implementation, and that implementation
in turn made real DNS lookups and real TCP connections over the actual
internet to the live production API. What it does **not** prove is that a
*real* `bsdsocket.library` (AmiTCP, Miami, Roadshow) on real AmigaOS
hardware behaves identically -- LVO offsets, calling-convention edge cases
at the hardware level, and real network timing under a real AmigaOS TCP
stack remain unconfirmed. This repository's emulator was built to match the
real protocol closely (see the fd-numbering fix below, itself a case of the
emulator being corrected to match real-hardware semantics), which is why
this evidence is meaningfully stronger than a native/POSIX run -- but it is
still emulation, not hardware. If you have access to a real Amiga or an
Amiga-accurate emulator, that is the one remaining verification step.

## Emulator run: what actually happened

Step 3 of this door's verification installed `doorrepo.amiga` as an XIM door
and ran it inside this repository's own 68K emulator (the same one that runs
every other door in `Doors/`), using the standalone door-run harness
(`web/backend/src/scripts/run-amiga-door.ts`) rather than a live BBS login,
so the run needed no browser and no interactive session.

**First pass found a real emulator bug, not a door bug.** The first attempt
stalled: `PortStart`/`JH_REGISTER` succeeded and the door registered with
the BBS's message port correctly, but the very next call the door makes,
`WaitSelect()` (waiting for a newly opened socket to become writable before
sending the HTTP request), never returned a usable result, and the door made
zero further progress until the harness's own execution-timeout forcibly
ended the session. This was root-caused (not merely observed) to this
emulator's `BsdSocketLibrary.ts` allocating socket descriptors starting at
100: `netio.c`'s `net_open()` builds `WaitSelect()`'s fd-mask the standard,
correct AmigaOS way, `wmask = 1L << s`, which is safe only for descriptors
below 32 -- an isolated vbcc compile of that exact expression confirmed the
generated `lsl.l d2,d1` zeroes the whole register for a shift count that
large, per real 68000 shift-count-modulo-64 semantics. That is not a bug in
this door: `1L << s` for a small `s` is exactly how real AmigaOS C code
builds this bitmask, and every real `bsdsocket.library` implementation hands
out small descriptor numbers. **This has since been fixed in the emulator**
(`BsdSocketLibrary.ts` now allocates descriptors from a low base below 32
and reuses them after `CloseSocket()`, confirmed by that fix's own commit
message and test suite) -- so this section now reports the **second**,
post-fix run, which is the one that matters.

**The re-run, with the fix in place, completed the entire flow end to end.**
`PortStart`/`JH_REGISTER` succeeded exactly as before, confirmed via the
per-door session log the emulator writes for every run
(`logs/door-68k-<command>-<timestamp>.log`):

```
[XIM] RX cmd=1 (JH_REGISTER) data=0 str=""
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="DoorRepo v1.0 - AmiExpress Door Repository Client"
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str=""
```

But this time the door did not stall. Within 4-6 seconds it had genuinely
fetched the real, live, 3301-row catalog over the emulator's
`bsdsocket.library` and rendered page 1 -- the row data below (including a
later row whose name field carries a real high-bit Latin-1 byte, rendered
correctly rather than corrupted) is byte-identical to the real live API's
first catalog page, not synthetic test data:

```
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="Page 1 of 166 (3301 doors total)"
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="INDEX ARCHIVE              TYPE   SIZE  NAME"
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="   1  !ALSTER.LHA          XIM      39 KB  Children"
```

Driven with a scripted input sequence (next page, previous page, filter by
type `DD`, back to the full catalog, search `trivia`, open the one result,
download, quit to browse, quit), it completed **every single step**
correctly: paging, the `DD` filter returning exactly the 10 real `DD` rows,
the search returning the one real `trivia` match (`AETRIV10.LHA`), a real
archive download over the emulated socket, and a genuine MD5 verification:

```
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="Downloading AETRIV10.LHA ..."
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="  ... 8 KB received"
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="Checksum verified OK (MD5 52ee1086c055fc1c82407dc0961ab04d)."
...
[XIM] RX cmd=4 (JH_SM (Send Message)) data=1 str="Goodbye!"
[XIM] RX cmd=2 (JH_SHUTDOWN) data=0 str="Goodbye!"
```

The binary-level session log confirms a clean finish: `Door completed:
doorrepo.amiga status=ok` (not the earlier run's forced-timeout teardown).
Independently, outside the door's own printed claim, the downloaded file on
disk was re-hashed directly: 16080 bytes, MD5 `52ee1086c055fc1c82407dc0961ab04d`
-- an exact match to both the catalog's declared digest and the door's own
printed result. The raw socket-library trace also confirms this was a real
network exchange, not a cache hit: `send data: GET
/api/door-repo/archive/AETRIV10.LHA HTTP/1.1` / `Host: bbs.uprough.net`,
followed by a real `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response from the live production
server.

**What this proves, precisely.** A real, unmodified, vbcc-cross-compiled
m68k AmigaOS executable ran inside this repository's own AEDoorPort/XIM
emulator, spoke the real door-port protocol, opened `bsdsocket.library`,
made real DNS/TCP calls over the real internet to the live production API,
fetched and correctly parsed a real 3301-row catalog, paged and filtered it,
downloaded a real archive, and verified its MD5 -- all inside emulation, all
confirmed against independent evidence (the per-door protocol log, the raw
socket trace, and a re-hash of the downloaded file), not merely the door's
own printed output. See "What 'not run-verified' means in practice" above
for the one thing this still does not prove: identical behavior on real
AmigaOS hardware or an Amiga-accurate emulator.

**Door registration: committed, not reverted, this time.** With the
underlying stall fixed and this end-to-end run demonstrating clean,
correct, repeatable completion (verified with fresh scripted-input runs,
no hangs, no crashes, exit code 0, orderly `JH_SHUTDOWN` both times),
`Commands/BBSCmd/DOORREPO.info` and `Doors/DoorRepo/doorrepo.amiga` are kept
installed and committed to this repository -- a working XIM door that
genuinely exercises AEDoorPort I/O plus `bsdsocket.library` networking end
to end is useful to keep around for future testing of both this door and
the emulator's networking layer.

**A later run added two more proven paths, and found a third emulator bug.**
`net_open()` now sizes the `WaitSelect()` fd-mask from `getdtablesize()`
rather than assuming the stack cooperates, and maps the `connect()` errno to
a specific message. Both were confirmed executing, not merely compiled:

```
[BsdSocketLibrary] Created socket fd=0
[BsdSocketLibrary] getdtablesize() - returning 32
[BsdSocketLibrary] connect(fd=0, 89.167.21.154:80)
```

and, pointed at a port with nothing listening, the door printed
`Could not reach the door repository server (netio: connect() refused).`
That message was then used as its own control: reverting the emulator's
`ECONNREFUSED` to the Linux value 111 (the classic BSD/AmigaOS value is 61)
made the identical run degrade to `(netio: connect() failed)`, which is what
proves the specific message is driven by the errno comparison and not by
something else in the path.

**The non-blocking connect path works too, as of a fourth emulator fix.**
`net_open()` sets `FIONBIO`, connects, waits for writability with a timeout,
then checks `SO_ERROR` - the standard AmigaOS sequence. The emulator used to
discard `FIONBIO` and block inside `connect()` for up to 30 seconds no matter
what timeout the door asked for, and its `getsockopt()` was a stub that wrote
nothing, so the `SO_ERROR` check could not have worked either. Both are
implemented now, and the real binary drives the whole sequence:

```
IoctlSocket(fd=0, FIONBIO, 1) -> nonBlocking=true
connect: non-blocking, returning -1/EINPROGRESS
WaitSelect returning 1
getsockopt(fd=0, SO_ERROR) = 0        (61 against a closed port)
```

Setting up that second run exposed the third emulator defect this door has
found: `gethostbyname()` was implemented with `dns.resolve4()`, so it
answered only what a DNS server would answer. A dotted-quad literal
(`192.168.0.10`) and a hosts-file name (`localhost`) -- the two things a
sysop is most likely to type into `DoorRepo.cfg` -- both failed, though real
AmiTCP/Roadshow resolves each without any DNS traffic. Fixed in the emulator
(`dns.lookup()`), with regression tests. As with the descriptor-numbering
bug above, the defect was in the emulator, not in this door.

## Security

Four distinct classes of vulnerability were found and closed during
development by adversarial code review, each requiring a genuinely different
fix -- listed here because a re-implementer copying this door's structure
needs to know the rules, not just that "it was reviewed":

1. **Shell command injection via sysop configuration.** `DownloadDir` and
   `LhaCommand` (from `DoorRepo.cfg`) are interpolated into a `system()`
   call to invoke the archive extractor. A `DownloadDir` value such as
   `INJECTDIR" ; touch /tmp/PWNED ; echo "` executed arbitrary shell
   commands. **Rule kept:** `LhaCommand` is validated with a strict
   **allowlist** (`[A-Za-z0-9_.:/-]` only, no whitespace, length-capped) --
   not a denylist. A denylist of shell metacharacters was tried first and
   bypassed twice (see #2); an allowlist is the only primitive that is safe
   for a value interpolated into a shell command line.
2. **Denylist bypass via an unquoted command position plus a comment
   character.** Before the allowlist fix, `LhaCommand=touch /tmp/PWNED #`
   executed: the trailing `#` commented out the rest of the generated shell
   command line, and `#` was not in the denylist. **Rule kept:**
   `LhaCommand` is a single allowlisted token as above; `DownloadDir`,
   `LogFile`, and `RepoPath` (which do need to accept a broader character
   set, since they are quoted paths, not commands) keep a denylist that now
   also rejects `#`, and are still shell-quoted when interpolated.
3. **Path traversal via a server-supplied archive name -- no shell
   metacharacters required at all.** A catalog row naming its archive
   `../../../../../../../tmp/.../PWNED.lha` made the door's own `fopen()`
   write outside `DownloadDir`, entirely independent of the shell-injection
   defenses above (a bare `/` is itself a parent-directory marker under
   AmigaDOS, so even `//S/Startup-Sequence` -- no `..` at all -- is a
   traversal on that platform). **Rule kept:** the server-supplied archive
   name is validated as a **filename** (`flow_is_safe_archive_filename()`):
   no `/`, `\`, `:`, `..` segments, leading dot, or control bytes -- as a
   check entirely separate from shell-command safety. This validation runs
   at catalog-parse time, so a hostile row is dropped before it ever becomes
   a selectable catalog entry, not merely re-checked right before use.
4. **Unbounded response bodies (resource exhaustion).** Neither the catalog
   fetch nor the archive download had any ceiling on total bytes received;
   a hostile or malfunctioning server (this door's server is plain HTTP,
   so this includes a MITM, not just a compromised repo) could send an
   unbounded stream regardless of what it claimed in `<count>` or
   `archiveSize`/`Content-Length`. This is worth calling out specifically:
   `DownloadDir` defaults to `T:`, which is conventionally a **RAM disk** on
   AmigaDOS, so an unbounded download is a memory-exhaustion attack against
   a 68020-class machine, not just a disk-filling nuisance. **Rule kept:**
   both response paths are byte-capped independently of what the server
   claims -- the catalog fetch at a fixed ceiling (measured against the real
   ~442 KB live catalog, with headroom), and archive downloads at the
   declared size plus bounded slack, clamped to an absolute maximum that
   cannot itself be inflated by a hostile `archiveSize` value.

**Accepted, deliberate exposure:** ANSI escape sequences and other control
bytes in a catalog row's `name`/`desc` fields are **not** stripped. Real
DoorRepo catalog rows legitimately carry scene-release ANSI art in these
fields (see `docs/DOOR-REPO-API.md`'s examples) -- stripping them would
corrupt correct, intended display for the majority of real entries. This is
a conscious trade-off, not an oversight.

**Known gap, by design:** the `LhaCommand` allowlist accepts only a single
token (a bare command name or path, e.g. `lha` or `Work:c/lha`).
Multi-token extractors (for example, `7z x`) are **not supported** -- no
`LhaArgs` configuration key exists to carry extra arguments. A sysop who
needs a multi-token extraction command is not served by this door as
shipped; adding an `LhaArgs` key (itself allowlisted per-token, joined with
single spaces, never taken as one free-form string) would be the natural
follow-up.

## Configuration

See `DoorRepo.cfg.example` for the full, commented reference -- every key,
its valid range, and what happens when a value is invalid (the line is
skipped, the default is kept, and the skip is counted and surfaced to the
sysop at startup; an invalid config never stops the door from running).
Copy it to `DoorRepo.cfg` next to the door binary and edit as needed; the
door runs correctly with no config file at all, using the defaults shown in
the example.

## Replacing the door-port layer

All BBS I/O goes through the six functions declared in `aedoor.h`
(`ae_start`, `ae_put`, `ae_get`, `ae_key`, `ae_check`, `ae_shutdown`,
`ae_fatal`). Two implementations exist: `aedoor_amiga.c` (the real
AEDoorPort/XIM message-port protocol, cited line-by-line against
`doordocs.txt`) and `aedoor_native.c` (a plain-stdio twin used for
development and the native unit tests). The Makefile picks one or the other
per target -- nothing else in this project contains `#ifdef AMIGA` except
`netio.c`. To retarget this door at a different door protocol or BBS
package entirely, write a third implementation of `aedoor.h`'s six
functions and point a new Makefile target at it; `doorrepo.c` and every
module beneath it needs no changes.

## The API contract

The full HTTP API this door speaks -- every endpoint, every field, worked
examples captured from the live server -- is documented in
`docs/DOOR-REPO-API.md`. That document makes an explicit **append-only
promise**: `list.txt` and the JSON manifest will only ever grow new fields
by appending them to the end of each row/object; existing fields never
change position, meaning, or type; and the header line's format-version
number is the authority for what fields a conforming client should expect
(see that document's "Append-only format-evolution promise" section). This
door's `listtxt.c` parser was built and tested against that promise
specifically: it reads only the first six fields by position and ignores
any trailing fields it does not recognize, so a future format revision that
only appends fields needs no change here at all.
